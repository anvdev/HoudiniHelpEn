== Locked and unlocked assets ==

When you create an asset, you create a new type of node, for example a new type of geometry node (SOP). You will also have an _instance_ of that node in the network.

When you first create an asset, the instance is _unlocked_ for editing. You can also unlock an asset for editing by right-clicking the node and choosing __Allow editing of contents__.

The names of unlocked assets appear in the network editor in +(fa-circle red) red. (The names of locked assets appear in +(fa-circle teal) teal.)

You can edit the parameters of nodes inside an unlocked asset, and change the asset's options in the [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].

When you edit the nodes inside an asset, you're editing the definition of the asset _in memory_. Other instances of the same asset will get the same changes, but the original definition of the asset still exists on disk.

* When you're done editing an asset's contents, you can right-click the node and choose __Save node type__ to save your changes to the library on disk. The node will still be unlocked, so right-click again and choose __Match current definition__ to lock it.

* Clicking __Apply__ or __Accept__ in the type properties window will also save the asset definition to disk.

* To discard any changes to an unlocked asset since the last save, right-click the node and choose __Match current definition__.

TIP:
    Houdini will allow you to edit a locked asset in the [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype], but when you click __Apply__ or __Accept__, it will prompt you to unlock the asset first.

== How to ==

:task:Unlock an asset to allow editing:
    Right-click an instance of the asset and choose __Allow editing of contents__.
    
    The names of unlocked assets appear in +(fa-circle red) red in the network editor.

:task:Save changes to an unlocked asset to disk:
    Right-click the unlocked node and choose __Save node type__.

:task:Lock a digital asset:
    Right-click the unlocked node and choose __Match current definition__. This will discard any changes since the last save.
    
    The names of locked assets appear in +(fa-circle teal) teal in the network editor.

:task:Edit an asset's options and parameters:
    Right-click an instance of the asset and choose __Type properties__ to open the [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].
    
    The controls in this window let you edit the basic options of the node type and its [user interface|asset_ui].

:task:Save changes in the type properties window to the asset definition:
    * In the type properties window, click __Apply__

:task:Prevent users from editing asset definitions:
    # Choose __Windows > Operator Type Manager__.
    
    # Click the __Configuration__ tab.
    
    # Turn on __Safeguard operator definitions__.
    
    See the help for the [operator type manager window|/ref/windows/optypemanager] for more information.
        
== Editing assets in a take ==

Normally, you will only want the creator/maintainer of an asset to make edit the asset, and lock the asset for normal use. However, if artists really need to make one-off changes to an asset, you can enable editing of assets in takes.

When this option and [auto-take mode|/basics/takes] are on, Houdini will allow anyone to edit any asset, even locked assets. However, changes to locked assets will actually take place in a [take|/basics/takes] overlaying the real defition of the asset. See the [help for takes|/basics/takes] for more information.

:task:Enable editing of assets in takes:
    # Choose __Edit > Preferences > Takes__.

    # Turn on __Allow auto take mode for locked assets__.
