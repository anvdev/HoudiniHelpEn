@key Setting keyframes

div class="oview">>
    *You can keyframe all animatable parameters on an object, or individual parameters.*
    
    In the parameter editor, animated parameters have a green background on keyframes and blue backgrounds on in-between frames. Pending changes that you haven't committed have a yellow background.
    
    Keys show up in the playbar. Green lines indicate keyframes, orange lines indicate pending changes.

div class="tmain">>
    Click or drag in the playbar (at the bottom of the main window) to move between frames. 
    
    table class="compact">>
        tr>>
            td>>((K))
            td>>
                Select an object and press ((K)) or press the playbar keyframe button to keyframe the object's parameters (or choose __Edit > Set Keyframe__).
        tr>>
            td>>((Shift + T))
            td>>
                Key the selected object's transforms.
        tr>>
            td>>((Shift + R))
            td>>
                Key the selected object's rotations.
        tr>>
            td>>((Alt + LMB))
            td>>
                Alt-click a parameter in the parameter editor to key that parameter value, or right-click the parameter and choose __Keyframes > Set Keyframe__.
    
@scope Scoping parameters

div class="oview">>
    *Scoping is the process of choosing which parameters to keyframe.*
    
    When you select an object, Houdini automatically scopes commonly keyed parameters (translates and rotations). You can customize this list of _autoscoping_ parameters. In __Edit > Preferences > Animation__ you can choose whether ((K)) keys all _scoped_ parameters or all _pending changes_.
    
    - [Learn more about scoping parameters|/anim/scope]
    
div class="tmain">>
    Choose __Windows > Channel editor__ to open a animation editor in a new window.
    
    This window displays animation channels for the _scoped parameters_. (The default desktop comes with a animation editor already tabbed behind the 3D viewer, but it's often useful to have it in a floating window instead.)
    
    Scoping means two things: the parameters appear in the animation editor, and they are keyed when you press ((K)) or choose __Edit > Set Keyframe__.

@curves Editing animation curves

div class="oview">>
    *Use the animation editor to view and edit animation channels as a graph, dopesheet, or spreadsheet.*
    
    The *cubic* function lets you adjust the in and out tangents of the segment by dragging the tangent lines coming out of the key boxes at each end of the segment. The *bezier* function lets you drag the round acceleration handle at the end of the tangent line.

div class="tmain">>
    [Image:/images/ui/channel_handles.png]
    
    Choose __Windows > Channel editor__ to open a animation editor in a new window.
    
    - Drag the boxes representing keys to move the keyed value up or down.
    
    - Drag the vertical lines through the key boxes to move the key backwards (left) or forwards (right) in time.
    
    - Select a curve segment (between keys) and use the toolbar on the right or the pop-up menu at the bottom to set the function controlling the segment's shape.
