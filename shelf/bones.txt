"""Allows you to interactively draw and manipulate bone chains before animating."""

This tool is used when modeling [characters|/character/].

== Using Bones == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bones][Bones|Node:obj/bone] tool on the __Characters__ tab.
    
    # Click ((LMB)) to place the chain of bones anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview], and continue clicking to add bones to the chain.
    
        * You can control interior snapping using the __Placement__ menu in the operation toolbar. This is useful for snapping bones to the midline of character skin geometry.
    
            By default, if a bone intersects a geometry node it will be placed within the geometry based on the view ("View based"). Otherwise the bone will be grounded on the construction plane.
            
            "Normal based" snaps within geometry based on the geometry normals rather than the view.
            
            "Freehand" does no interior snapping.
        
        * You can add, remove, and change kinematics in the drop-down menu on the operations toolbar, or click ((RMB)) the bones in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            
            If you create a chain of bones with inverse kinematics a [Icon:OBJ/null][null object|/shelf/null] will appear at the end of the chain which allows you to easily move the bones while it is grounded by the chain root.
    
    # Press ((Enter)) to finish the chain.
    
    # Name the chain of bones in the __Chain Name__ field on the operations toolbar.

<!--
The Bones operation lets you interactively draw and manipulate bone
chains before animating. For a complete list of the mouse controls at
all times, please refer to the status line at the bottom of the Houdini
window. The common tasks are described below.

DRAWING BONE CHAINS

To draw a new bone chain, left-click repeatedly in the viewer to
position the joints, then right-click to finish. The bone chain will be
created using the type specified in the "Kinematics" option and 
positioned based on the "Placement Method" option, both located
directly above the viewport. For "Follow Curve" bone chains, expect to
be prompted for a curve object. To start drawing from any object,
Shift+Left click on the object that you wish to extend from.

To change bone chain kinematic types, first choose the "Remove
Kinematics" option from the Ctrl+Right mouse menu. Select the bones that
you wish to remove kinematics for, then right-click to complete. Now,
change your Kinematics option to the new type. Finally, choose the "Add
Kinematics" option from the Ctrl+Right mouse menu. Houdini will prompt
you for the required object selections to perform the operation.

CHOOSING THE PARENT FOR A NEW BONE CHAIN

To select a parent, Ctrl+Middle click on the desired object. The new
bone chain that you draw after this will have this object as its parent.
To reset back to no parent, Ctrl+Middle click on emptiness in the
viewer, away from all objects.

SPLITTING A BONE

To divide a bone into two, Ctrl+Left click on the desired bone.

MANIPULATING JOINTS

A Joint handle is created for all the currently displayed bones when you
enter the Bones operation. To adjust the position of any joint, click or
drag the square handles that you see positioned at the tips of bones. If
you do not wish to accidentally click on these squares, toggle them off
by pressing the Joint handle button in the left toolbar, or right-click
on any Joint handle and toggle its Display Handle option. To manipulate
several handles at the same time, select them by holding SHIFT key.

The Joint handle operates in several modes. Right-click on any of the
square handles to see the complete list. The translate handle
manipulates the joint position. The rotate handle spins the bone about
its origin. The spider handle adjusts the lengths of the bones connected
at the joint and moves the joint along the average normal of those
bones.

WHAT TO DO NEXT

Before binding the bones to the skin with Capture Geometry, you may want
to adjust the capture regions with Edit Capture Regions, then mirror the
bone chain with Mirror if you need a symmetrical limb. After Capture,
use Pose to animate the bones and see if any capture weights need
tweaking. If so, experiment with editing capture regions (procedurally)
or with Paint/Edit Capture Weights. Mirror Capture Weights will come in
handy if you have painted or hand-edited the weights of one limb and
want them reflected automatically to save time.

TOOL PARAMETERS

The Bones tool provides parameters that control the way bones are
created or manipulated. The parameters dialog can be accessed through
Operator > Parameter Window... menu option.

Chain Name - the name prefix for the generated bones

KIN Chop Net Name - the name of the CHOP network in which the inverse
kinematics solver CHOP is created (for the IK bone chains)

Chain Parent - the parent of the first bone in the chain that will be
generated

Link Geometry - the geometry used to visually represent the bone

Kinematics - the kinematic behaviour of the bone chain

Placement Method - the placement method used for creating the bone 
chain. The view method places the bone wihin the closest intersecting
geometry based on the view direction. The normal method places the 
bone inside the closest intersecting geometry based on the normal of the 
first intersection point. Freehand grounds the bone to the 
construction plane.

Set Render Flag on Link Geometry - specifies whether the visual bone
representation is rendered or not

Set Keep position when parenting flag on null objects - specifies
whether the parenting flag parameter is set on bones (i.e., bone
position before and after parenting is the same)

Set xray flag on bone chains - specifies whether the x-ray flag is set
on bones (i.e., whether occluded bones are visible in the viewer)

Parent chain root to IK affectors - specifies whether the first bone is
parented to the affector

Update locked bone positions at capture frame - specifies whether the
capture bone arrangement is corrected for locked capture attributes when
manipulating the joints of the bone chain at the capture frame. This is
an obsolete parameter that applies to old rigs, when the capture pose
was defined at the capture frame (and not by the global capture bone
pose). When Capture SOP was locked, manipulating joints of capture bones
in such situations resulted in an undesirable geometry deformations,
that was resolved by a Capture Correct SOP. The Update locked bone
positions parameter detect the locked SOPs and automatically inserts a
Capture Correct SOP when joints are manipulated.

Edit tab - provides parameters for manual generation of bones

Coloring tab - provides parameters that assign coloring scheme to bones
