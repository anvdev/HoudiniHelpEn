This tool lets you pick a piece of geometry and configure it as vellum cloth.  Rather than building a DOP network, it uses the SOP-level tools to build a simple network to work with the cloth.

== Using Simple Cloth == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to solve as cloth at the SOP level.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/vellum_simplecloth]__Simple Cloth__ tool on the __Vellum Core__ tab.

    # Select the geometry object to use as a collider, if any. This should be a polygonal object.  To collide with volumes or heightfields, use the DOP-based setup.
    
For specific parameter information, see the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] and [Vellum Solver|Node:sop/vellumsolver] help.

== Working with Simple Cloth ==

* You can change the __Thickness__ and __Mass__ of the cloth on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node. This allows you to set these parameters per piece of cloth.

* The __Drag__ constraints are useful when animating flags or other objects that are affected by wind.

* The __Pin to Animation__ parameters on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node allow you to directly select points in the viewport to pin using the [Icon:BUTTONS/reselect] reselect button.

    Choosing __Stopped__ as the __Pin Type__ sets a `stopped` attribute to `1` to make the point a hard constraint. This will act like a __Permanent__ constraint that isn't affected by forces. However, you can restore dynamics if you choose to move the pin later by resetting the `stopped` attribute to `0`. This can be done using a [POP Awaken|Node:dop/popawaken].
    
    NOTE:
        Choosing __Permanent__ won't allow you to release the constraint later.
    
* Setting a lower __Compression Stiffness__ allows the cloth to collapse and regain its fluidity. This usually has to be increased for higher resolution cloth so that it doesn't look too much like silk.
