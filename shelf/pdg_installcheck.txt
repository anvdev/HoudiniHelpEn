    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/pdg_installcheck] __Installation Check__  tool on the __TOPs Utils__ tab.
    
    # Decide whether to load the test scene or to merge it into your current scene. Merging, testing and then deleting the test topnet may be a time saver.
    
    # Choose which tools to check.
    
    # The scene will be loaded with the desired test graphs connected to the `endNode`.
    
    # Additional information about installation and testing is visible in the network view. If you are merging the test network into a scene with existing TOP networks, you may need to open the testing topnet in a separate pane.

    # Cook the `endNode` to perform the installation tests.
