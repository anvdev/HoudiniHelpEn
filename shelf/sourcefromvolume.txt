"""Continuously generates smoke, fire, or liquid from the interior of an
object."""

This tool continuously generates fluid from the interior of an object and is
similar to [Source from Points|sourcefrompoints] and
[Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface]. Since sourcing is done from inside
of the object, the selected geometry is required to be closed and watertight.

NOTE:
    If selection consists of volume or VDB primitives, this shelf tool will
    instead import these into the DOP network. For example, you can manually
    create a `divergence` volume and import it into the simulation with this
    tool.

The tool will create a setup tailored towards the simulation it is applied to.
In case of a smoke simulation, it will import `density` and `temperature`,
causing smoke to rise from the selected object. If applied to a pyro
simulation, the shelf tool will inject `fuel` and `temperature`, turning the
surface into a flame source. Finally, the tool will add the necessary nodes
to continuously emit liquid into a FLIP simulation, similar to
[Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid].

TIP:
    If you want the sourced smoke to inherit the object's motion, you can use
    the [Point Velocity|Node:sop/pointvelocity] SOP to calculate its velocity.
    The velocity attribute will then be transferred to the scattered points by
    the [Pyro Source|Node:sop/pyrosource] node and converted into a VDB by the
    [Volume Rasterize Attributes|Node:sop/volumerasterizeattributes] SOP.

== Using Source from Volume ==

    # Create an open geometry object within a container.
        For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke]
        [Smoke Container|smokebox] or [Icon:SHELF/box_fire]
        [Pyro Container|firebox].

    # Select the geometry object to generate the source.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume]__Source from Volume__ tool on
    the __Populate Containers__ tab.

    # Select the container to put the source into and press ((Enter)) to
    confirm your selection.

NOTE:
    To turn off the continuous flow of fluid, set the __Activation__ to `0` on
    the [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node in your DOP network. You can
    [keyframe|/anim/basics] this parameter to control when the fluid is
    emitted.

NOTE:
    If the object is only partially in the container, only the portion of the
    object that is within the container's boundaries will be simulated.
