"""Tetrahedralizes input geometry, configures it as a Vellum softbody, and adds it to current Vellum simulation."""

This tool lets you pick a piece of geometry and configure it as a tetrahedral Vellum softbody.  It will then be added to the active simulation and merged with any other existing Vellum objects.

This tool will first simplify, remesh, and tetrahedralize the input geometry before simulation.  Afterward the simulated geometry is brought back into this network and used to deform the original geometry with a [Point Deform SOP|Node:sop/pointdeform].  A tetrahedral softbody consists of two types of constraints.   Soft __Distance__ constraints are created along each tetrahedral edge to act as springs to maintain the general shape of the object and __Tetrahedral Volume__ constraints are created to maintain the volume of each tetrahedron, providing local volume preservation.

== Using Vellum Tetrahedral Softbody == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to configure as Vellum tetrahedral softbody.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELFellum_softbody_tetrahedral]__Vellum Tetrahedral Softbody__ tool on the __Vellum__ tab.

    NOTE:
        There is a [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] tool on the __Vellum__ shelf that you can use for objects that will be colliding with your softbody. It is essentially the same as the [Deforming Object|/shelf/deformingobject] shelf tool on the __Collisions__ tab, as they are both designed for deforming objects. However the [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] does not try to generate a VDB collision object, which is less expensive.
        
    TIP:
        You can visualize __Volume Stress__ by selecting it from the __False Color Mode__ dropdown menu on the [Vellum Solver|Node:sop/vellumsolver]. This shows you where the constraints have had to work the hardest maintain volume. You can also visualize __Volume Distance__, which displays how far they've changed in volume from the rest state.

== Working with Tetrahedral Softbody ==

The resolution for the tetrahedral mesh can be changed by adjusting the __Target Edge Length__ on the [Remesh SOP|Node:sop/remesh] and the __Max Tet Scale__ on the [Solid Conform SOP|Node:sop/solidconform].  The accuracy of the overall shape can be adjusted with the __Number to Keep__ parameter on the [PolyReduce SOP|Node:sop/polyreduce], although increasing this very high can lead to slow remeshing.

By default the Stretch __Stiffness__ for the __Distance__ constraints is quite low on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node to make it more squishy. To make it less squishy you can increase this value.

To smooth out artifacts in the [Point Deform SOP|Node:sop/pointdeform], you can try increasing the __Minimum Points__ and the __Radius__.
