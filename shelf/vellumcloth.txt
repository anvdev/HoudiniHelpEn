"""Configures vellum cloth from geometry and adds to current vellum simulation."""

This tool lets you pick a piece of geometry and configure it as vellum cloth.  It will then be added to the active simulation and merged with any other existing vellum objects.

Vellum cloth consists of a surface that doesn't stretch or shear, but is able to bend with some amount of bend stiffness.

NOTE:
     The internal collision and solve representation is always triangles, so quadrilateral meshes are implicitly triangulated.  This can lead to what look like collisions when the triangulation for the render differs from the one used for the solve.

== Using Vellum Cloth == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to configure as vellum cloth.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/vellum_cloth]__Vellum Cloth__ tool on the __Vellum__ tab.
    
    NOTE:
        There is a [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] tool on the __Vellum__ shelf that you can use for objects that will be colliding with your cloth. It is essentially the same as the [Deforming Object|/shelf/deformingobject] shelf tool on the __Collisions__ tab, as they are both designed for deforming objects. However the [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] does not try to generate a VDB collision object, which is less expensive.
        
For specific parameter information, see the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] and [Vellum Solver|Node:dop/vellumsolver] help.

== Working with Vellum Cloth ==

* One of the first things you may want to tweak is the __Thickness__ parameter on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node. It's important that the cloth is the right thickness for the effect you're trying to achieve.

* Another commonly changed parameter is the __Stiffness__ parameter on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node. This determines how bendy the cloth will be.

* The Stretch and Bend __Damping Ratios__ are two parameters that are set low by default. You can try bumping these up by factors of 5 to make your cloth look slightly less rubbery.

* The __Constraint Iterations__ default value of `100` is pretty good for most mid-resolution cloth on the [Vellum Solver|Node:dop/vellumsolver]. However if you have high resolution cloth you may have to increase that value to `200` or even `500`. The general rule is to use the number of points across the diameter of the cloth.

* The __Layer Shock__ parameter on the [Vellum Solver|Node:dop/vellumsolver] controls how much lighter to make each layer of cloth when you have multiple layers. The default is to make the bottom layer 4 times heavier than the top layer. The `layer` attribute can be set with the __Layer__ parameter on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node.
