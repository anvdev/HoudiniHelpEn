"""Converts an object into a collision volume that can interact with
smoke/fire/liquid in a fluid container."""

The shelf tool converts its geometry into appropriate volumes, then imports
them into the DOP network using a [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node.

NOTE:
    As of Houdini 14, the recommended way of setting up collision objects for
    fluid simulations is by using [Icon:DOP/staticobject]
    [Static Object|staticobject] or [Icon:SHELF/deforming_object]
    [Deforming Object|deformingobject] shelf tools under the
    [Collisions|collisions] tab.

== Using Collide with Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox] or
    [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Pyro Container|firebox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface],
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create a collision volume:
    # Select the object you want to turn into a collision volume.
    
    # On the __Populate Containers__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/make_collision]
    __Collide with Objects__ tool.
    
    # Select the fluid container you want to collide and press ((Enter)).
