= Paint Base Color =

"""Interactively changes the color of fur by painting your geometry."""

This tool is useful for interactively modifying the color of fur. It allows
you to manually tint the color of fur on the skin geometry.

After adding fur with the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool, use the
[Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool and some of the paint tools to style
the fur.  Finally, use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.

== Using Paint Base Color == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/paint_base_color][Paint Base Color|paintbasecolor] tool on the __Hair__ tab.

    # Select the fur object to paint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Choose the color to paint by clicking the color swatch in the __FG__ field and selecting a color, or by changing the values in the text boxes next to the color swatch.

    # Drag the [brush|/basics/brush] over the surface to paint it.

        NOTE:
            You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar. You can also alter the __Opacity__ in the Operation Controls toolbar.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/paint][Paint|Node:sop/paint] node help.

NOTE:
    The color is part of the contained material node. You can adjust this value by navigating to the __Material__ parameter on the __Basic__ tab of the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur], and then locating its __Base Color__ parameter on the referenced SHOP node.

== Tips ==

Houdini will recook each time a brush stroke is made. To improve responsiveness while painting, reduce the __Display Density__ on the __Basic__ tab of the [Icon:SOP/fur][Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. If this does not speed up Houdini enough, you can turn off the __Display__ checkbox which will disable the display of hairs for improved responsiveness while you paint the geometry. 

If you simply want to turn off the display of hairs for a moment when painting, you can hide other objects in the viewport by clicking [Icon:VIEW/show_all] in the viewer toolbar and selecting __Hide Other Objects__. This has the same effect on performance as turning off the __Display__ checkbox on the fur object. Once you are done painting you can click [Icon:VIEW/show_all] and choose __Show All Objects__ to display the fur again.

Once you paint the color, you may want to use some of the other paint tools to style the fur, such as: [Paint Density|/shelf/paintfurdensity], [Paint Length|/shelf/paintfurlength], [Paint Clumping|/shelf/paintfurclumping], [Paint Frizz|/shelf/paintfurfrizz], [Paint White Hair Density|/shelf/paintwhitehairdensity], [Paint Guard Hair Density|/shelf/paintguardhairdensity], or [Paint Guard Hair Length|/shelf/paintguardhairlength].

You may also want to use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.
