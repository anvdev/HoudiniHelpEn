= Blend =

"""Blends the positions and orientations of the current object transform with target objects."""

This tool will blend the current object transform with other objects.

== Using Blend Constraint ==
             
    # Click the [Icon:COMMON/blend] Blend tool on the __Constraints__ tab.
                
    # Choose the object you want to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Select one or more targets objects in the desired order. Hold ((Shift)) to select multiple objects.

    # Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters]. Some of the toolbar parameters match node parameters directly (such as __Mask__ and __Weight__), while other (such as __Mode__, __Keep Position__, and __Add Keyframe__) affect how the nodes are created.

    # Press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one.

A [Simple Blend|Node:/chop/constraintsimpleblend] node is created based on the selected objects and the blend mode. The constraint is added after the node that has the output flag and the output flag is set to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

Mode:
    The blend mode.

    Proportional:
        Creates a [Blend node|Node:chop/constraintblend] in __Proportional__ mode. This supports multiple targets.
    Difference:
        Creates a [Blend node|Node:chop/constraintblend] in __Difference__ mode. This supports multiple targets.
    Sequence:
        Creates a [Sequence node|Node:chop/constraintsequence]. This supports multiple targets.
    Simple Blend:
        Creates a [Simple Blend node|Node:chop/constraintsimpleblend]. This supports  only a single target.

Mask:
    Select which transform components to blend.

Weight:
    The initial blend weight.

Keep Position:
    When Keep Position is on, applying the constraint won't change the current object position.

    Off:
        The constraint will blend the target transforms without keeping an offset.
    Before:
        Targets are pulled using the [Node:chop/constraintobjectoffset] instead of the [Node:chop/constraintobject]. This means that the targets keep their own offset.
    After:
        An offset node is created after the constraint.

Add Keyframe:
    Add a transition keyframe to enable the constraint at the current time.
