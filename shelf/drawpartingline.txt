"""Lets you draw a parting line on the skin geometry. """

This tool lets you draw a line on skin geometry, which stops any generated hair from being influenced by guide curves on the other side of the line. This is useful for getting a clean split along a line, for example where guides have already been groomed in opposite directions.

Clicking [Icon:FUR/addparting] __Part Guides__ on the __Guide Process__ tab will put down a [Draw Curve SOP|Node:sop/hairclump] and [Guide Partition SOP|Node:sop/guidepartition] where you can paint on the skin geometry. For more information, see the [Guide Partition SOP|Node:sop/guidepartition] help page.
