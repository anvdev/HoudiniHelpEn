= Emit Steam on Collision =

"""Emits steam when a hot fluid comes into contact with a collider."""

This tool will take a viscous fluid and apply a secondary steam simulation, where steam is emitted whenever a hot fluid comes into contact with collision objects. You would typically use this tool to simulate lava coming in contact with a wet surface and evaporating the water.


== Using Emit Steam on Collision ==

# Select the hot fluid to emit steam from.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/emit_steam]__Emit Steam__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

    For specific parameter information, see the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] help page.

:task: Control how much steam is emitted:
    Modify the __Scale__ parameter on the `density` __Source Volume__ of the `source_density_from_steam_source` DOP. This will adjust how much steam is emitted globally.
    
    You can also adjust the __Scale__ parameter on the `create_density` node in the `steam_source` object.
         
:task: Create thin and wispy smoke:
    Use the controls on the __Shape__ tab of the [Pyro Solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver]. For thin and wispy smoke, you'd want high dissipation and high-frequency turbulence and disturbance.
    
:task: Create thick smoke:
    Use the controls on the __Shape__ tab of the [Pyro Solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver]. For thick smoke, you'd want low or no dissipation and lower frequency turbulence.
