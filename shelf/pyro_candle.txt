"""Creates a smooth burning candle flame rising from the selected object."""

This shelf tool sets up a preset pyro effect resembling a candle flame. The
pyro system has low burn and gas release rates, so it looks smaller and less
dynamic than other pyro presets. The preset uses disturbance to perturb the
flame slightly. This preset releases almost no energy and so doesn't use up
much fuel.

One simple way to increase the height of the flame is to remap the Emit Range
on the Pyro object's multi-field visualization to make more of the flame
visible.
