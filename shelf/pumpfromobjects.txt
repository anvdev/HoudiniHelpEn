"""Gives smoke a velocity as soon it touches the pump."""

This tool can be used to give smoke direction. The selected geometry is
converted into a `pump` volume that defines the region of the pump's influence,
and a velocity volume, `v`. The velocity fields is obtained by rasterizing the
`v` attribute of points scattered on the surface. Hence, the selected geometry
must have the desired pump velocity stored in the `v` attribute.

NOTE:
    You can use the [Point Velocity|Node:sop/pointvelocity] SOP to add a `v`
    point attribute to geometry.

NOTE:
    This tool only works with smoke and pyro simulations.

== Using Pump from Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox] or
    [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Pyro Container|firebox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface],
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create a pump:
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_pump]__Pump from Objects__ tool.

    # Select the object to generate the velocity and press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the fluid container and press ((Enter)).
    
:task:Control the added velocity:
    In the DOP network, find the [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node
    importing the pump field (named `source_v_from_<<object>>`).
    
    Use the __Scale__ parameter for the `vel` field to control the added
    velocity. You can keyframe this value to delay and/or limit the pump time,
    pulse the pump, etc.

In the example below, the sphere is a liquid source, and the box is a pump:
