"""Creates dry ice fog falling from the selected object."""

This shelf tool sets up a falling smoke effect resembling dry ice fog. The
preset uses a negative __Scale__ value for temperature sourcing on the
[Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node to create cold smoke that will fall
instead of rise.

The preset uses a high diffusion rate to make the smoke settle quickly and
create the appropriate "drizzling" look.

On the [Pyro Solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver] node, the dissipation range is
remapped to start below zero, to correctly evaporate the fog over time.

Use the Disturbance and Turbulence controls on the pyro solver to add detail or
change motion.

See [how to use the pyro tools|/pyro/pyro].
