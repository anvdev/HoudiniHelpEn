= Pose-Space Deform =

"""Allows you to perform a pose-space deformation (PSD) of a shape."""

This tool allows you to build a library of poses and pose-space edits as well as the pose-space deform node that drivers the pose-space deformation (PSD). PSD is an example-based deformation where the target geometry will react to its current pose, object parameters, or other channels.

== Using Pose-Space Deform ==

    # Using the [Icon:TOOLS/pose] Pose tool put the character in a pose that requires a pose-specific shape correction.

    # Select the SOP to deform or an existing pose-space deform node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network].

    # Click ((LMB)) the [Icon:SOP/posespacedeform] Pose-Space Deform tool on the __Modify__ or __Animation__ tab.

	The Pose-Space Deform pane will open and the new pose-space edit will be selected.

        Click ((LMB)) the type of pose-space deform to create if the selected SOP is not a pose-space deform node.
                
    # Alter the object's geometry as needed with the Edit tool.
           
NOTE:
    Make sure the Pose-Space Deform is set to Inactive when you are making changes to a pose-space edit in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
