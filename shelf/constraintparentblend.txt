= Parent Blend =

"""Blends between parent objects."""

This tool will blend the transform of the current parent with other objects and apply the current local object local transform on top.

== Using Parent Blend Constraint ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/parent] Parent Blend tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

    # Choose the object you want to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Select one or more parents objects in the desired order. Hold ((Shift)) to select multiple objects.

    # Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters]. Some of the toolbar parameters match node parameters directly (such as __Mask__ and __Weight__), while other (such as __Mode__, __Keep Position__, and __Add Keyframe__) affect how the nodes are created.

    # Press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one. 

A [Parent|Node:chop/constraintparent] node is added along with one [Simple Blend|Node:/chop/constraintsimpleblend] node based on the new parent objects and blend mode. The constraint is added after the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

Mode:
    The blend mode.

    Proportional:
        Creates a [Blend node|Node:chop/constraintblend] in __Proportional__ mode. This supports  multiple targets.
    Difference:
        Creates a [Blend node|Node:chop/constraintblend] in __Difference__ mode. This supports  multiple targets.
    Sequence:
        Creates a [Sequence node|Node:chop/constraintsequence].  This supports multiple targets.
    Simple Blend:
        Creates a [Simple Blend node|Node:chop/constraintsimpleblend]. This supports only a single target.

Mask:
    Select which transform components to blend.

Weight:
    The initial blend weight.

Keep Position:
    When Keep Position is on, applying the constraint won't change the current object position.
    Targets are pulled using the [Node:chop/constraintobjectoffset] instead of the [Node:chop/constraintobject].

Add Keyframe:
    Add a transition keyframe to enable the constraint at the current time.
