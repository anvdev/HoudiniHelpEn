= RBD Convex Proxy =

"""Creates a number of rigid bodies from SOP geometry, which use proxy geometry from a convex decomposition."""

This tool uses the [Convex Decomposition SOP|Node:sop/convexdecomposition] to generate proxy geometry for the RBD objects. A compound collision shape built from several convex hulls can be much faster to simulate for concave geometry.

This tool is similar to the [RBD Sphere Proxy tool|/shelf/rbdsphereproxy] on the __Rigid Bodies__ shelf. However, instead of using proxy geometry composed of spheres, it preserves hard edges and creates more accurate shapes. [RBD Sphere Proxy tool|/shelf/rbdsphereproxy] is very lightweight and fast, which is useful for background objects where you don't mind rounded out corners as a tradeoff for speed. Convex Decomposition is useful for more complex or foreground objects with many hard edges.

== Using RBD Convex Proxy == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry to convert to RBD objects.

    # Optionally, define the pieces to be fractured. For example, using the [Shatter tool|/shelf/shatter].

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/rbdconvexproxy][Shelf:rbdconvexproxy] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    # Modify the parameters of the [Node:sop/convexdecomposition] SOP, if necessary, to adjust the concavity threshold used by the convex decomposition.

    # Switch the display flag to the [Node:sop/xformpieces] SOP to see the original geometry transformed based on the motion of the proxy objects.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdpackedobject][RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] or [Icon:SOP/convexdecomposition][Node:sop/convexdecomposition] help.
