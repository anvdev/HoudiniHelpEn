"""Turns on the color fields of a smoke object."""

This tool changes the necessary settings for a pyro or smoke simulation to
enable coloring of smoke. In addition to modifying the smoke object, this tool
also searches for [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] nodes in the network
and adds color to the simulation through them. Finally, the SOP source is
traced back to ensure that a color field is present and ready to be imported
into the smoke simulation.

See [how to use the pyro tools|/pyro/pyro].
