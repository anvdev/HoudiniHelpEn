"""Apply a transform as a constraint with an optional pivot."""

This tool will let you transform the current object and an optional pivot object.

== Creating a Transform Constraint ==

# Click ((LMB)) the [Icon:SOP/xform] Transform Constraint tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

# Select the object you want to transform and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

# Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters] to select the pivot mode.

# Select the object for the pivot and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to continue without a pivot object.

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one.

A [Transform CHOP|Node:chop/constrainttransform] is created based on the selected objects. The constraint is added after the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

Pivot Mode:
    The Pivot position and orientation can be defined in local space using the node 
    parameters or in global space using the third input. The Pivot Mode lets you use the position and/or orientation from the Input #3.
