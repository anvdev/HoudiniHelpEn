= Sink from Objects =

"""Absorbs smoke, fire, liquid, or particle fluid in a container."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a drain in a container of
liquid, or an open window in a room full of smoke.

== Using Sink from Objects ==

# Create a geometry object within a container, which will become your sink
object.

# Generate fluid to be removed with the sink. You can use either particle
(FLIP) or volume (smoke, pyro) based fluid.
  For more information on creating particle based fluid see the
[Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid] help and
for more information on creating volume based fluid see the
[Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface],
[Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], or
[Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volumes|sourcefromvolume] help
pages.

# Select the geometry object to remove the fluid.  

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink]__Sink from Objects__ tool on the
__Populate Containers__ tab.
 
# Select the container, and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
