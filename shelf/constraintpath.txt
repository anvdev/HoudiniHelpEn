= Follow Path =

"""Animates an object along a curve."""

This tool is useful for quickly [animating|/anim/] an object moving along a specified [path|/shelf/curve]. For example, you can make a plane fly across the sky.

== Using Follow Path Constraint ==

# Create the object you want to animate along a path.

# Use the [Icon:SHELF/drawcurve] [Draw Curve tool|/object/path] on the __Create__ tab to to draw a curve freehand in space or on an object.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/followpath] Follow Path tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

# Select the object to associate to the path and press ((Enter)).

# Select the path you want the object to follow and press ((Enter)).

# Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters] to create the constraint with or without offset.

# Choose the object for the look at target position and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to continue without a look at target.

# Choose the object for the look up target position and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to use the default up vector.

This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one. 

A [Follow Path CHOP|Node:chop/constraintpath] is created based on the selected objects. The constraint is added after the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.
