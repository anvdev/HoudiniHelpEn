== Tips ==

* If the object has a velocity point attribute (`v`), the
  [Volume Rasterize Attributes|Node:sop/volumerasterizeattributes] SOP will
  create a velocity volume for the simulation.
  
  To add velocity attributes to the object, use the
  [Point Velocity|Node:sop/pointvelocity] SOP.

* Use the disturbance and turbulence controls on the Pyro Solver's __Shape__
  tab to add detail or change motion.
  
* Use the settings on the object's [Pyro Source|Node:sop/pyrosource] and
  [Attribute Noise|Node:sop/attribnoise] SOPs to change the emission.
