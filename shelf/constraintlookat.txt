= Look At Constraint =

"""Makes an object point at another object."""

This is often to make [Icon:OBJ/light][Lights|Node:obj/hlight] or [Icon:OBJ/camera][Cameras|Node:obj/cam] follow a moving object. It is also useful to control where a character's eyes will point.

== Creating a Look At Constraint ==

    # Click ((LMB)) the [Icon:SHELF/lookat] Look At tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

    # Select the object you want to orient and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Review the [Toolbar Parameters|#parameters] to create the constraint with or without offset.

    # Choose the object for the look at target position and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to create a new null object and use it.

    # Select the object for the look up target position and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection or press ((Enter)) without a selection to use the default up vector.
    
This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object, or reuses an existing one. 

A [Look At CHOP|Node:chop/constraintlookat]  is created based on the selected objects. The constraint is added after the node that has the output flag and the output flag is moved to the new node.

@parameters Toolbar Parameters

Keep Position:
    When Keep Position is on, applying the constraint won't change the current object position.
