"""Creates flames rising from the selected object."""

Note: the effect created by this tool in Houdini 12+ looks different from the
equivalent preset in prior versions of Houdini.

This preset uses a low gas release rate to create persistent flames without
an explosion. It has a high heat output so the smoke from the fire rises
faster than the flames.

On the [Pyro solver node|Node:dop/pyrosolver]...

* Use the __Smoke amount__ to control the amount of secondary smoke.

* Use the __Shredding__ controls to rip the streaks apart.

* Use the __Disturbance__ and __Turbulence__ controls to add detail or
  change motion. Flames usually need high turbulence.

* For more detail you can also lower __Temperature Diffusion__.

* Use __Flame Height__ to change the height of the flames.

* For thicker smoke, turn on __Create Dense Smoke__ and lower the
  __Heat Cutoff__.
