"""Creates spray, foam, and churn based on an underlying FLIP fluid simulation."""

This tool sets up the [source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] and [solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] for a whitewater simulation. Whitewater emission particles are created from a source  [FLIP|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] or [liquid|/shelf/liquidbox] simulation based on several criteria including fluid acceleration, curvature, and vorticity. The simulation uses these emission particles and volumes from the fluid simulations as sources for simulating whitewater with foam, spray and bubble particles.

TIP:
    Do not try to set up a whitewater simulation from scratch.

== Using Whitewater ==

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/whitewater][Whitewater|Tool:whitewater] tool on the
  __Particle Fluids__ tab.

# Select a [FLIP Fluid Object|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] or 
  [Liquid Object|/shelf/liquidbox] and press ((Enter)) to complete your 
  selection.  

NOTE:
    You may need to navigate into the DOP Network containing the fluid object to select it.

=== Whitewater Source ===

This is where the spray and foam come from, and where the most important parameters to change the look of your whitewater are located. 

- The __Curvature__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node allows you to control where the whitecap is created. You can specify at what surface curvature to emit whitewater as well as the __Max Velocity Angle__.
        
- The __Acceleration__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node controls whitewater where then are velocity changes. For example, if the fluid changes direction suddenly, like when a wave collides with a rock and goes back in the opposite direction.

- The __Vorticity__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node looks for areas that are spinning, or the curling of velocity. When water is churned, bubbles are created. This is not typically something you would want in an ocean, unless a boat is traveling through, or a person is failing around in the water.
        
=== Whitewater Sim ===

This where the whitewater simulated, and where you can modify the animation.

- The [Whitewater Emitter|Node:dop/whitewateremitter] picks up points and uses them as sources to generate particles.

- The [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] is where you can control the three aspects of whitewater: foam, spray, and bubbles.

    - __Foam__ are particles that sit on the surface. __Advection Strength__ is an important parameter on this tab because it controls how strongly the foam sticks to the surface. Parameters on the __Lifespan__ tab are also important because the let you control how long before the foam dissipates. For example, dense foam should live longer than if it was spread out thinly (less foam around).
            
    - __Spray__ is particles that have left the surface. This tab is important to control how the spray will act. For example, adding __Drag__ will prevent the spray from shooting too far away.
            
    - __Bubbles__ are particles below the surface. This tab lets you control how closely the particles mimic the fluid around it, as well as how fast the bubbles move to the surface and turn into foam. Typically you use this in fast moving water simulations, such as a river.

TIP:
    Typically you will not need to make changes on the __Solver__ tab.

=== Import Whitewater ===

This is the result of `whitewater_source` and `whitewater_sim` combined.
