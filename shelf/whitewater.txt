= Whitewater =

"""Creates spray, foam, and churn based on an underlying FLIP fluid simulation."""

This tool sets up the [source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] and [solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] for a whitewater simulation. Whitewater is created from a source [FLIP|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] simulation based on several criteria including fluid acceleration, curvature, and vorticity. Whitewater enhances the look of fluid animation with secondary effects such as spray, foam, and bubbles.

TIP:
    Do not try to set up a whitewater simulation from scratch.

== Using Whitewater ==

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/whitewater][Whitewater|Tool:whitewater] tool on the
  __Particle Fluids__ tab.

# Select a [FLIP Fluid Object|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] and press ((Enter)) to complete your 
  selection.  

NOTE:
    You may need to navigate into the DOP Network containing the fluid object to select it.

=== Whitewater Source ===

This is where the spray and foam come from, and where some of the most important parameters to change the amount and location of your whitewater can be found.

- The __Curvature__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node allows you to control where the whitecap is created. You can specify at what surface curvature to emit whitewater as well as the __Max Velocity Angle__.
        
- The __Acceleration__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node controls whitewater where then are velocity changes. For example, if the fluid changes direction suddenly, like when a wave collides with a rock and goes back in the opposite direction.

- The __Vorticity__ tab on the [Whitewater Source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] node looks for areas that are spinning, or the curling of velocity. When water is churned, bubbles are created. This is not typically something you would want in an ocean, unless a boat is traveling through, or a person is flailing around in the water.
        
=== Whitewater Sim ===

This where the whitewater is simulated, and where you can modify the animation.

- [Whitewater Object|Node:dop/whitewaterobject] is the container for whitewater. It contains several visualization options for the particles, as well as parameters that control the nature of their interactions with collision objects.

- The [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] is where you can control the behavior of the whitewater particles.

    - The __Emission__ tab has controls for birthing particles. You can also set different aging rates for bubbles, foam, and spray here, which will result in particles having different lifespans based on their depth.

    - You can set the simulation region and states of its boundaries in the __Limits__ tab. Here you can also give the solver access to the signed distance field of the collision geometry. This is important if you expect whitewater to come to rest atop other objects: without access to this signed distance field, particles may get wrong forces applied to them.

    - The solver's __Forces__ tab allows you to set the basic forces that are experienced by whitewater particles and their effect at different depths. With default settings, for instance, buoyancy force opposes gravity and only acts on submerged particles.

    - The __Foam__ tab contains the more advanced mechanisms that drive whitewater dynamics.

        - __Clumping__ is responsible for maintaining particle density, giving whitewater fluid-like behavior.

        - __Erosion__ can be used to preserve whitewater in denser areas and accelerate particle reduction in regions where whitewater is more scarce.

        - __Repellants__ can be used to generate cellular foam patterns.

        - __Adhesion__ can help in preventing whitewater from separating from the liquid's surface.

TIP:
    Typically you will not need to make changes in the __Advanced__ tab.

=== Import Whitewater ===

This is the result of `whitewater_source` and `whitewater_sim` combined.

== Tips ==

* The __Visualization__ tab on the [Whitewater Source node|Node:sop/whitewatersource] has controls for visualizing things like curvature, acceleration, and vorticity. Enabling __Source Particles__ can be useful to get an idea of the emission amount that will be generated in your simulation by setting the __Whitewater Scale__ and __Emission Amount__ values to the same values as the matching parameters on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver].

* The __Whitewater Scale__ parameter on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] controls particle separation. You can use a higher value when testing for quicker simulation playback, and then reduce to a smaller value later for more particles and more detail.

* Increasing the __Aging Rates__ of bubbles, foam, or spray on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] will boost it's death chance by that amount. For example, if you don't want bubbles in your whitewater but you want foam to stick around for a longer period of time, you can set the  __Bubbles Aging Rate__ to a higher value and set the __Foam Aging Rate__ to a lower value.

* To prevent particles from over accumulating in small regions or from separating too far, use the __Clumping__ controls on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver]'s __ Foam__ tab. This will give the whitewater a more cohesive look.

* Get foam to stick to the surface of the fluid and prevent artifacts when rendering by using the __Adhesion__ controls on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver]'s __ Foam__ tab.

* The __Erosion__ controls on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver]'s __ Foam__ tab can be used to eat away whitewater from the outside inward and eliminate whitewater that has separated from the main body.

* Repellants are used to create cellular foam patterns in whitewater. These parameters are on the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver]'s __ Foam__ tab.  The __Noise Range__ and __Pulse Frequency Range__ parameters control the look and shape of the repellants. Repellants with a higher pulse change shape more rapidly, and repellants that are less noisy appear more circular. For more information see the [Whitewater|/fluid/whitewater] page in the Fluid chapter.

    NOTE:
        Unless __Density Threshold__ is enabled, repellants are not affected by whitewater.
