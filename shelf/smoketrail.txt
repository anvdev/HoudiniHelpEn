"""Generates a clustered simulation of smoke from an animated object."""

== Overview ==

This tool creates a complex geometry network to generate clustered source
geometry for the smoke from points scattered along the object's animated path.
Each cluster of points is simulated in a separate smoke box. Simulating a
series of smaller boxes along the path is much more efficient than simulating
all smoke in one large box.

== How to ==

:task: Give an animated object a smoke trail:
    The object should already be animated before you use this tool.

    # Select an animated object.

    # On the __Pyro__ shelf, click the Smoke Trail tool.
    
        The tool creates a Geometry object to generate the smoke source
        (`<<objectname>>_sourcepts`), a simulation network (if it doesn't
        already exist), and a Geometry object to import the results of the
        simulation back as renderable geometry.

:task: Prevent the smoke from rising:
    Modify the `temperature` point attribute in the `<<objectname>>_sourcepts`
    network before the `rasterization` loop.

    ~~~ or ~~~

    Change the buoyancy on the `pyrosolver` node.

    ~~~ or ~~~

    In the DOP network, select the `source_density_from_` node and set
    __Scale__ parameter for temperature import (under the __Volumes__ tab) to
    `0`.

:task: Change the smoke density:
    Modify the `density` point attribute in the `<<objectname>>_sourcepts`
    network before the `rasterization` loop.
    
    ~~~ or ~~~
    
    In the DOP network, select the `source_density_from_` node and change the
    __Scale__ parameter for density import (under the __Volumes__ tab).

:task: Make the smoke dissipate faster or slower:
    In the DOP network, select the `pyrosolver` node. Click the __Shape__ tab,
    then change the __Dissipation__. Higher values make the smoke dissipate
    faster.

:task: Apply a material to the smoke:
    # In the [material palette|/ref/panes/materialpalette], drag one of the
    materials from under the Volume heading in the tree on the left to the area
    on the right to create an instance of the material.
    
        Different materials give different looks to the generated smoke at
        render time. For example, "Wispy Smoke" looks less dense than "Billowy
        Smoke".
    
    # In the network editor, at the object level, select the `pyro_import`
    node. This node imports the results of the simulation (the generated smoke)
    to make it a renderable object. This object is where you should apply the
    material.

    # In the parameter editor, click the __Render__ tab. Click the
    [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser icon next to the __Material__ field.
    Select the material you just created (for example, `/mat/basicsmoke`) and
    click __Accept__.
