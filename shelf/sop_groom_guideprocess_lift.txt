"""Lifts curves off the skin or flattens them against it."""

This tool lifts curves off the skin or flattens them against it. This applies a rotation, similar to the [Set Direction|sop_groom_guideprocess_setdir] tool.

Clicking [Icon:FUR/lift_hair] __Lift Guides__ on the __Guide Process__ tab will put down a [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] with the __Operation__ parameter set to __Set Lift__.  For more information, see the [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] help page.
