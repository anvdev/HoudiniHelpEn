= Houdini Engine Plugin Installer =

"""Manage Houdini Engine Plugin installation."""

== Overview ==

This tool allows you to install, update or uninstall the Houdini Engine plug-ins available in your install folder.

== Using the Plugin installer ==

Upon launching the tool, the available plugins will be listed in the Houdini Engine section. Only the plugins selected during the installation of Houdini, and therefore copied to $HFS/engine will appear in the list.

After selecting the version of the plugin, the tool will automatically try to find the host application on your machine, and populate the path and plugin path for the host.

If the host application was not automatically found, you can select a custom path for the host by clicking on the browse button next to the host path.

You can also explore both the houdini engine and host plugin folders by using the jump buttons next to the Plugin paths.

Once the host application path is found or set, the tool will indicate if a previous version of that plugin was found, and let you install/update or uninstall it.

If the host application is installed in a protected folder, the tool will indicate this, and invite you to restart Houdini in Admin mode. This can be achieved by using the "Restart Houdini As Admin" button.
