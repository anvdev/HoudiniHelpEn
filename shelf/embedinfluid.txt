= Embed in Fluid =

"""Allows an object to react and move with a fluid."""

This is often used with an object that has been converted to points. You can either store data on the points or instance geometry. Embed in Fluid is usually used for tracking [fluid|Node:dop/fluidobject] flow passively, by using marker particles. 

This tool only works with volume based fluid.

== Using Embed in Fluid ==

# Create a geometry object and source within a container.
    
    For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox] or [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox].

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/move_with_fluid]Embed in Fluid tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

# Select the object to embed in fluid and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

This example shows a [grid|Node:sop/grid] that has been converted to points embedded in the [fluid|Node:dop/fluidobject] to track the flow.

TIP:
    Increase the __Feedback Scale__ parameter on the __Internal Forces__ tab of the [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] when using fluid to push a rigid body object.
