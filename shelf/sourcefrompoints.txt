"""Continuously generates smoke or fire from the points of an object."""

This tool continuously generates fluid from the points of an object and is
similar to [Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface] and
[Source from Volumes|sourcefromvolume]. When sourcing into a pyro or smoke
simulation, a [Pyro Source|Node:sop/pyrosource] SOP is created to add the
necessary point attributes to the input geometry, which are then converted into
VDB's by a [Volume Rasterize Attributes|Node:sop/volumerasterizeattributes]
node. Note that a volumetric object is required for sourcing a liquid
simulation; as such, this shelf tool will behave the same way as
[Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface] when applied to a FLIP simulation.

The tool will create a setup tailored towards the simulation it is applied to.
In case of a smoke simulation, it will import `density` and `temperature`,
causing smoke to rise from the selected object. If applied to a pyro
simulation, the shelf tool will inject `fuel` and `temperature`, turning the
surface into a flame source. Finally, the tool will add the necessary nodes
to continuously emit liquid into a FLIP simulation, similar to
[Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid].

TIP:
    If you want the sourced smoke to inherit the object's motion, you can use
    the [Point Velocity|Node:sop/pointvelocity] SOP to calculate its velocity.
    The velocity attribute will then be transferred to the scattered points by
    the [Pyro Source|Node:sop/pyrosource] node and converted into a VDB by the
    [Volume Rasterize Attributes|Node:sop/volumerasterizeattributes] SOP.

== Using Source from Points ==

    # Create an open geometry object within a container.
        For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke]
        [Smoke Container|smokebox] or [Icon:SHELF/box_fire]
        [Pyro Container|firebox].

    # Select the geometry object to generate the source.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points]__Source from Points__ tool on
    the __Populate Containers__ tab.

    # Select the container to put the source into and press ((Enter)) to
    confirm your selection.

NOTE:
    To turn off the continuous flow of fluid, set the __Activation__ to `0` on
    the [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node in your DOP network. You can
    [keyframe|/anim/basics] this parameter to control when the fluid is
    emitted.

NOTE:
    If the object is only partially in the container, only the portion of the
    object that is within the container's boundaries will be simulated.
