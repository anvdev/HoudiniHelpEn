= Smooth Guides =

"""Blends the shapes of the neighboring guides to create a smoother look. """

This tool blends the shapes of the neighboring guides to create a smoother look by averaging the neighboring curves, making them more similar to each other. This gives the appearance of a smoother groom with less local variation, and preserves aspects of the groom that are already similar between neighboring guides.

Clicking [Icon:FUR/smooth] __Smooth Guides__ on the __Guide Process__ tab will put down a [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] with the __Operation__ parameter set to __Smooth__. For more information, see the [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] help page.
