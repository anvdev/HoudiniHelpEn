"""Creates a force that pushes fluid away from the selected object."""

This shelf tool uses a [Icon:SOP/flipsource][FLIP Source|Node:sop/flipsource]
node to convert the selected geometry into a divergence volume that can be used
to exert an expansive force on a fluid system. This is useful for manually
creating and controlling explosions.

== Using Expand from Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox] or
    [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Pyro Container|firebox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface],
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and
    [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create an expansion force:
    # Select the object you want to turn into an expansion field.
    
    # On the __Populate Containers__ tab, click the
    [Icon:SHELF/expand_from_objects]__Expand from Objects__ tool.
    
    # Select the fluid container you want to expand in and press ((Enter)).

:task:Control the amount of expansion:
    In the DOP network, find the [Icon:DOP/volumesource]
    [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node importing the divergence field
    (named `source_divergence_from_<<object>>`).
    
    Use the __Scale__ parameter on the divergence import to control the amount
    of expansion. You can keyframe this value to delay and/or limit the
    expansion time, pulse the expansion, etc.
    
    Sometimes very high values may be necessary (100+) to have visible effects.
