= Set Guide Direction =

"""Points guides in the direction of a vector."""

This tool points guides in the direction of a vector. The direction can be set with a vector parameter or by using a skin attribute. The value of the skin attribute is read at the position closest to the root of each curve. The tools allows separate control over the rotation around the skin normal and skin tangent (called direction and lift).

Clicking [Icon:FUR/comb] __Set Guide Direction__ on the __Guide Process__ tab will put down a [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] with the __Operation__ parameter set to __Set Direction__.  For more information, see the [Guide Process SOP|Node:sop/guideprocess] help page.
