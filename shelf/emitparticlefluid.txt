= Emit Particle Fluid =

"""Emits fluid into a FLIP simulation."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate water continuously pouring out
of a tub, bucket, or a watering can.

== Using Emit Particle Fluid == (includeme)
    # Create a geometry object in the shape you want to emit fluid.
    
    # In the __Particle Fluids__ shelf tab, click the
    [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter]__Emit Particle Fluid__ tool.

    # Select the geometry object to emit the fluid, then press ((Enter)).

    # If you have an existing FLIP object you want to add the new emitter to,
    select it and press ((Enter)).

      Otherwise, just press ((Enter)) and the tool will create a new particle fluid object for you.
