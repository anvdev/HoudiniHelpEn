= Bake Constraints =

"""Bake Constraints on selected objects."""

This tool will disable the constraints on selected objects and bake the constraints transform back to the local parameters.

== Using Bake Constraints ==
             
    # Select one or more objects. Hold ((Shift)) to select multiple objects.

    # Click the [Icon:CHANNELS/bake_keys] Bake Constraints tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

This tool creates a temporary [Bake Animation|Node:out/bake_animation] and uses it to bake the constraint transforms to the selected object set one keyframe per frame. This tool requires less setup time than setting up a ROP node.
