= Add Clip =

"""Adds an animation clip to an agent primitive."""

This tool adds a new animation clip to an agent.
The source can be either a character rig in the scene, or an FBX file on disk.

== Using Add Clip ==
    # Click the Add Clip tool on the __Crowds__ tab.
    # Select the agent primitive to add a clip to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    # If the animation source is a character in the scene, click [Smallicon:BUTTONS/reselect] to interactively select the character, or [Smallicon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] to use a node chooser dialog.
    # If the animation source is an FBX file, click __FBX__ and then select the file using [Smallicon:BUTTONS/chooser_file].
    # Enter a name for the animation clip, and then press the OK button to finish.
