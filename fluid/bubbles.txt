= How to |> make bubbles =

Creating bubbles with a FLIP fluid simulation requires removing the FLIP particles where you want to create a bubble and then enabling __Enforce Air Incompressibility__ on the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver]. This feature prevents air pockets from collapsing and can be used to create rising bubble effects.

== Make a rising bubble in a tank ==

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/flip_tank][FLIP Tank|/shelf/fliptank] for simulating bubbles.

# Add a [Icon:SOP/sphere][Sphere|/shelf/sphere] in the tank and modify its size and placement to create the desired initial bubble shape.

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink][Sink|/shelf/sinkfromobjects] from the sphere and select the FLIP Tank to add the sink to.
	
	NOTE:
	    Make sure to adjust the division size of the __Fluid Source__ to account for any changes in the sphere size.

# Set the activation of the __Source Volume__ to generate a bubble at the desired frames.

# Enable __Enforce Air Incompressibility__ on the __Air__ tab of the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] so that the bubble created by the sink doesn't immediately collapse.

	TIP:
	    If you encounter bubble volume changes during the simulation, it might be helpful to enable __Detect Droplets__ on the __Droplets__ subtab of the __Particle Motion__ tab, and set the __Behavior__ to __Kill at Fluid__. Adjusting the __Min/Man Particle Density__ will also help control the volume change.
