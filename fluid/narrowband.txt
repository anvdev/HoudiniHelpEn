== Initializing a FLIP simulation with narrow band ==

A standard FLIP fluid simulation begins with the liquid volume entirely filled with particles.
Even with narrow band enabled in the __FLIP Solver__, the particles will only be removed
once the simulation begins. For large simulations, these particles can occupy a large amount
of memory, only to be destroyed immediately after. Instead, the FLIP simulation can
be initialized directly as a narrow band.

The following example describes how to generate a fluid simulation with the narrow band initialized from the start.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/testgeometry_rubbertoy][Rubber Toy|Node:sop/testgeometry_rubbertoy] using the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] in the viewport. This will be the object used to create the narrow band simulation.

# Use the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid][FLIP Fluid from Object|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] tool on the __Particle Fluids__ shelf to create a FLIP simulation, selecting the [Rubber Toy|Node:sop/testgeometry_rubbertoy] as the object to convert to FLIP fluid.

# In the `testgeometry_rubbertoy_object1` node, create a [VDB from Polygons SOP|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons] and set the __Voxel Size__ to match the FLIP simulation. For example, an expression that multiplies the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject]'s particle separation by its grid scale. 

# Set the [VDB from Polygons|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons]'s input to the __Rubber Toy__'s output.

# Add a [Null SOP|Node:sop/null] node after the [VDB from Polygons|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons] named __SURFACE__.

# Add a [VDB Reshape SDF SOP|Node:sop/vdbreshapesdf] after the [Null|Node:sop/null], set __Operation__ to __Erode__, and __Offset__ to match the narrow band's __Bandwidth__ parameter in the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

# Add a [VDB Combine SOP|Node:sop/vdbcombine] and connect the the first input to the __SURFACE__ [Null|Node:sop/null]'s output and the second input to the [VDB Reshape|Node:sop/vdbreshapesdf]'s output. This creates the narrow band volume to seed particles into.

# On the [VDB Combine|Node:sop/vdbcombine] node, set the __Operation__ to __SDF Difference__.

# To seed particles in the narrow band, create a [FLIP Source SOP|Node:sop/flipsource] and connect the input to the output of the [VDB Combine|Node:sop/vdbcombine] node. 

# Set the __Voxel Size__ to match to the [VDB from Polygons|Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons] node, __Particle Separation__ to match the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject], and the oversampling settings to match the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

# Add a [Null SOP|Node:sop/null] node after the [FLIP Source|Node:sop/flipsource] and name it __PARTICLES__.

# Set __Input Type__ in the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] to __Narrow Band__, the __SOP Path__ to the __PARTICLES__ node path, and the __Surface Volume__ to the __SURFACE__ node path.

# Activate __Enable Particle Narrow Band__ in the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

NOTE:
    If you want a custom initial velocity field, it can be connected into the FLIP simulation by adding the velocity volume path to the __Velocity Volume__ parameter in the [FLIP Object DOP|Node:dop/flipobject]. The particles that have been generated above must be initialized by the same velocity field.

== Pairing particle attributes and volumetric fields ==

It is not possible to set variable liquid parameters such as `viscosity`, `density`, `temperature` or `color` using particle attributes, because any particles deeper inside the liquid volume than the narrow band are removed during each simulation step. Instead, you can bind particle attribute data
to volumetric fields using the __Attribute/Field Pair__ option.

The following example describes how to create a simulation where colored liquid pours into a clear container. The particles that sink into the container and past the narrow band are removed from the simulation, but the color persists on the volumetric field. The `color` attribute is advected through the simulation via this volumetric field.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/flip_tank][FLIP Tank|/shelf/fliptank] tool on the __Particle Fluids__ shelf to create a FLIP Tank to pour the colored liquid into.

# At the Object level, dive into the `fliptank_initial` node, and create an [Attribute Create|Node:sop/attribcreate] node between the `initial_particles` and `OUT_INITIAL_PARTICLES` nodes.

# Set the __Name__ to `Cd` and __Type__ to `Vector`.

# In the __AutoDopNetwork__, add a [Vector Field DOP|Node:dop/vectorfield] between the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] and the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] and set __Data Name__ to `Cd`.

# Create an [Enable Solver DOP|Node:dop/enablesolver] and connect its output to the __Volume Velocity__ (3rd) input of the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver]. 

# Add the expression `$FF==2` to the __Enable Solvers__ parameter in the [Enable Solver|Node:dop/enablesolver] node in order to initialize the custom field at the beginning of the first simulated frame. This is the second frame by default.

# Create a [Gas Match Field DOP|Node:dop/gasmatchfield] and connect its output to the input of the __Enable Solver__. 

# Set __Field__ to `Cd`, __Reference Field__ to `surface`, and __Rank__ to `Vector`.

# Navigate back to the Object level and click the [Icon:SOP/sphere][Sphere|Node:sop/sphere] tool on the __Create__ shelf. Move it above the water level of the tank and scale to your desired size.

# Click the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid tool|/shelf/emitparticlefluid] tool on the __Particle Fluids__ shelf, select the sphere as the object to emit fluid from, and select the FLIP particles to emit fluid into.

# At the Object level, dive into the Sphere object and place an [Attribute Create SOP|Node:sop/attribcreate] node between the [FLIP Source|Node:sop/flipsource] node and the [Null|Node:sop/null] node.

# Set __Name__ to `Cd`, __Type__ to `Vector` and __Value__ to `1,0,0,0`.

# Navigate back to the [FLIP Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] in the AutoDopNetwork and make sure __Enable Particle Narrow Band__ is turned on.

# Click the ((+)) button next to __Attribute-Field Pairs__ parameter and set `Cd` for both __Attribute__ and __Field__.

NOTE:
    In order to save the color fields during the simulation, add `Cd` to __Fields__ in the [DOP I/O|Node:sop/dopio] node (`import_fliptank`) inside of the `fliptank_fluid` object.
