= opflag =

"""Returns a list nodes with a particular flag set."""

:usage: `opflag(<<network>>, <<flag>>)`

The <<flag>> argument follows the same convention as the opset
command. Examples are:

"d":
    Display Flag
"r":
    Render Flag
"t":
    Template
"b":
    Bypass
"l":
    Lock.
"e":
    Expose
"h":
    Highlight
"f":
    Footprint
"s":
    This should be the save data in a motion file flag. However, for
    backwards compatibility it is aliased to the pick flag. Use of "s"
    should be replaced with "p"
"u":
    Unload data after cook (surface nodes and CHOPs only).
"c":
    This should be the compress icon flag. However, for backwards
    compatibility it is aliased to the "C" flag. Use of "c" should be
    replaced by "C".
"C":
    Current
"p":
    Picked
"P":
    Display descriptive parm.
"O":
    Output For View.

The following flags are only available for objects:

"S":
    Selectable in viewport
"x":
    Object pivot axes
"y":
    Xray

The following flags are only available for CHOPs.

"a":
    Audio
"o":
    Export
