:usage: `ftrim(<<number>>)`

Type conversion is usually done automatically. However, you may wish to use this to force the conversion.

The `ftrim()` function will also round the number to 6 decimal digits of precision, avoiding slightly off numbers caused by floating point not being able to exactly represent common decimal numbers.
