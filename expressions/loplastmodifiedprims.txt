"""Returns the paths of the USD primitives last modified by a LOP node."""

:usage: `loplastmodifiedprims(<<lop_path>>)`

LOP nodes may set the paths to the USD primitives most recently modified by
the node. For example a LOP node that creates a USD primitive would set
this value to the newly created USD primitive. A LOP node which edits several
USD primitives may set it to the paths of all the modified primitives. This
expression function returns these stored USD primitive paths for the node
specified by the <<lop_path>> parameter.

If more than one primitive was modified by the LOP node, the paths are
returned in a single string separated by spaces.

Using this expression function it is easy to create and edit scene graph
hierarchies without using complex channel referencing expressions.
