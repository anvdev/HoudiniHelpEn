= arg =

"""Returns an argument from a list of HScript-style arguments."""

:usage: `arg(<<line>>, <<argNum>>)`

This function extracts an argument from a line. The example below will
extract the time out of the date string returned by the system function.
arg is useful for extracting tokens from space delimited strings.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    arg("This returns foobar from this sentence", 2)
    }}}
    
    Returns the third word from the sentence: foobar.

    {{{
    #!exp
    arg (system("date"), 3)
    }}}
    
    Returns the fourth word from the date command. This is usually
    the system time, ie: 15:26:31.

    {{{
    #!exp
    arg("Quoting 'makes this one arg'", 1)
    }}}
    
    Returns "makes this one arg" as the quoting has transformed that
    into a single token. Note the quotes are not present in the output.
