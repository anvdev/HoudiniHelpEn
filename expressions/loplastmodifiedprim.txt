"""Returns the path of the USD primitive last modified by a LOP node."""

:usage: `loplastmodifiedprim(<<lop_path>>)`

LOP nodes may set the path to the USD primitive most recently modified by
the node. For example a LOP node that creates a USD primitive would set
this value to the newly created USD primitive. A LOP node which edits a
USD primitive may set it to the path of the modified primitive. This
expression function returns this stored USD primitive path for the node
specified by the <<lop_path>> parameter.

Using this expression function it is easy to create and edit scene graph
hierarchies without using complex channel referencing expressions.
