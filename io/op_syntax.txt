= Use data from a node instead of a file (op:) =

#bestbet: op

== Overview ==

In various places in Houdini, nodes may have a parameter which expects a file name of a file containing a specific type of data. In these types of parameters you can usually use `op:<</path/to/node>>` instead of a file name to grab data from live nodes in the scene hierarchy instead of from a file.

For example, the [Volume Sample from File VOP|Node:vop/volumesamplefile] gets the value at a certain position in a volume. It has a __Geometry file__  parameter for a volume file name, but you could sample a volume in a SOP network instead of a file on disk using something like:

{{{
op:/geo1/volume1
}}}

...as the value of the __Geometry file__ parameter.

This works for (at least) the following common file types:

* Geometry file: surface node (SOP)
* Image file: compositing node (COP)
* Channel data file: channel node (CHOP)


== COP node modifiers ==

* You can specify a frame number, by appending a frame number in _square brackets_, for example `[23]`.
* You can specify one or two plane names by appending them in _braces_, for example `{Cd}` or `{Cd,alpha}`.
* You can override the resolution by appending the width and height in _parentheses_, for example `(640,480)`.


== Relative op: references ==

The path after `op:` must be an _absolute path_ (that is, starting from the root of the scene hierarchy with `/`). However, you can work around this by converting a relative path to an absolute path using the [Exp:opfullpath] expression function inside backticks:

{{{
op:`opfullpath('../../volume1')`
}}}
