= Clustering smoke and pyro simulations =

== Overview ==

_Clustering_ partitions a large or sparsely-distributed smoke or pyro
simulation into multiple (possibly overlapping) fluid boxes instead of one
giant box.

Using multiple small boxes has several advantages:

* Can be distributed to multiple processes and/or machines on a farm.

* Solves faster since the computer doesn't have to deal with the empty spaces
between the important parts of the overall simulation.

* The small boxes can be much higher resolution, or multiple resolutions,
whereas a giant box usually must have a lower resolution because of memory
limitations.

The multiple containers created by these tools are _separate simulation
objects_ with _no interaction between each other_. For example, density cannot
move out of one container into an adjacent one. This is usually not a problem
for smoke and fire simulations.

== Creating a clustered smoke/pyro simulation from point sources ==

# Select the object you want to emit from.

# On the __Pyro FX__ shelf tab, click [Icon:SHELF/smokecluster] Smoke Cluster
or [Icon:SHELF/pyrocluster] Pyro Cluster.

    * The tool creates a new network named `<<objectname>>_sourcpts`.

    * The new network contains a [Icon:SOP/scatter][Scatter|Node:sop/scatter]
    node that creates points on the input geometry's surface.

    * These points are then partitioned by a [Icon:SOP/clusterpoints]
    [Cluster Points|Node:sop/clusterpoints] surface node. The clustering
    branches off into nodes operating on the "instance points" (the points that
    will emit smoke/fire) and "cluster points" (the points on which the
    containers will be centered).
    
    * On the "instance point" branch it creates a [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fire]
    [Pyro Source|Node:sop/pyrosource] and [Icon:SOP/attribnoise]
    [Attribute Noise|Node:sop/attribnoise] nodes to set appropriate values for
    the necessary point attributes, which are then rasterized into volumes.

    * In the DOP network, the tool creates a regular [pyro setup|pyro]. On the
    [Smoke object|Node:dop/smokeobject], it turns on
    __Create Objects From Points__ (in the __Instancing__ tab) and imports the
    cluster points from the geometry network.

# To change the number of containers, in the geometry network select the
[Icon:SOP/clusterpoints][Cluster Points node|Node:sop/clusterpoints] and modify
the __Clusters__ parameter.
