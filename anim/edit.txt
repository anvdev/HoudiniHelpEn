= Edit keyframes and channels =

Use these techniques to  [select channels in  the Channel List|scope].

== The animation editor ==

The [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] provides three different interfaces for editing animation. Choose __Windows > Channel editor__ to open a animation editor window, or [create a animation editor pane tab|/basics/panes]. Then use the button strip in the top left corner of the animation editor to select one of the following views.

- The [Icon:CHANNELS/view_graph] *Channel graph* displays the animated values of channels as a graph. You can edit the shapes of the animation curves between keys, move keys backward or forward in time, and edit keyed values. [How to edit animation with the channel graph|/ref/panes/changraph].

- The [Icon:CHANNELS/view_dopesheet] *Dopesheet* shows keys as colored squares on a grid of channels and frames. [How to edit animation with the dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet].

- The [Icon:CHANNELS/view_table] *Channel table* shows the channels as a spreadsheet of values and frames. [How to edit animation with the channel table|/ref/panes/chantable].

== Editing keys on the timeline ==

You can move, squash, copy, and cycle the key markers on the timeline instead of in the animation editor when it's more convenient. See the [playbar help|playbar] for how to edit keys directly on the timeline.
