= Working with the Channel List =

"""The Channel List is used to select which parameters are displayed in the animation editor and on the timeline."""

== Overview ==

When press ((K)) to [set keyframes|basics], _Houdini keys the values of the parameters in the Channel List_. When selecting objects, Houdini will usually [auto-add channels to the Channel List|#autoscope]


== How to see which channels are in the Channel List ==

To see what channels are in the Channel List, click the Channel List button on the right side of the playbar to open a floating Channel List or open the Animation Editor.

[Image:/images/ui/channel_graph.png]

The bottom left sub-pane of the Animation Editor shows the Channel List. You can click the name of a channel to show or hide the channel in the graph display. This changes the channel list selection. You can choose to key all the channels or only the selected channels by changing the __Global Set Key__ [animation preference|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim].

The playbar __Channel List Button__ also displays Channel List statistics about the number of selected channels, the total number of channels, the number channels that have keys at the current frames and if channel list filtering is active.

The Parameter Editor can also display a visual hint if a parameter is in the Channel List. See the __Underline in the Parameter Editor__ animation preference [animation preference|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim].

TIP:
    The top left sub-pane lists the [channel groups|channel_groups]. You can choose __View > Channel List__ or press ((Tab)) in the animation editor to hide this sub-pane.


== How to add channels to the Channel List ==

- *When you select an object*, certain parameters will be _auto-added to the channel list_. These are usually the most important parameters for animation, such as translation (position), rotation, and scale. Different types of objects may have different default auto-add lists (for example, the Dimmer parameter on lights has the auto-add to channel list flag.). You can customize which parameters are auto-add for each object (see below).

    Customizing the auto-add parameters is especially useful when you only want to key a couple of channels (for example, Translate Y and Translate Z of a bouncing ball), since you can make sure than whenever you select and key the ball, only those channels are keyed, without paying attention to the channel list.

- *To add a single parameter or channel to the Channel List*, right-click the parameter name (for all channels in the parameter, such as all translates) or an individual component (for just that channel, such as Translate Y) in the parameter editor and choose __Channels > Add to Channel List__.

    _or_
    
    ((Shift + MMB)) a parameter name or individual component in the parameter editor.

- *To _isolate_ a parameter or channel to the Channel List*, right-click the parameter name (for all channels in the parameter, such as all translates) or an individual component (for just that channel, such as Translate Y) in the parameter editor and choose __Channels > Isolate in Channel List__.

    _or_
    
    ((Shift + LMB)) a parameter name or individual component in the parameter editor.
    
    _or_
    
    Drag a parameter name or individual component into the channel list of the animation editor or channel list pane.

TIP:
    You can also use the mouse click with modifiers shortcuts on parameter editor tabs and groups.
    If you don't remember the shortcuts, you can get them by right-clicking on a parameter.

TIP:
    When you start adding channels to the Channel List manually, you will probably notice that the Animation Editor window pops out in front of the screen.
    You can turn it off by setting the __Open Animation Editor if Closed__ animation preference [animation preference|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim].

== Keep Channel List Selections == (keepselection)

When you select an object, you can choose to reset the channel list selection to its default state or keep the channel list selection in the state it was.

You can turn it on by setting the __Keep Channel List Selection__ animation preference [animation preference|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim] or on the playbar channel list refresh button's drop-down menu.

TIP:
    You can quickly switch between different objects in the Animation Editor without having to always reselect the channels you want to edit if you keep channel list selections.

TIP:
    This works really well with the __Modify Channels state tool__ using the ((J)) key.

== Auto-add to the Channel List == (autoscope)

When you select an object, certain parameters will be _automatically added to the channel list_. A list of default auto-add parameters is set for each object type, with the parameters you usually want to animate, such as translates, rotations, and scales.

You can customize which parameters are auto-add for each object. This is especially useful when you only want to key a couple of channels (for example, Translate Y and Translate Z of a bouncing ball), since you can make sure than whenever you select and key the ball, only those channels are keyed, without paying attention to the channel list.

* Select the object you want to customize. In the parameter editor, right-click a parameter name or number field and choose the __Channels > Auto-Add__ checkbox.

* Select nothing, then select the object again to check whether which channels are auto-added to the channel list.

TIP:
    When you create a digital asset, you can choose which of the asset's parameters auto-add in the __Parameters__ pane of the asset's [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].

== Auto-select in the Channel List == (autoselect)

When you select an object, certain parameters will be _automatically added to the channel list_ and by default all are selected in the Channel List.
You can use change the default Channel List selection state of a parameter by turning off the __Auto-Select__ flag.
This is normally used to provide secondary controls on a rig controller that you don't want to keyframe all the time, such as the FK/IK blend on a foot controller.

* Select the object you want to customize. In the parameter editor, right-click a parameter name or number field and choose the __Channels > Auto-Select__ checkbox.

* Select nothing, then select the object again to check whether which channels are auto-selected in the channel list.

TIP:
    When you create a digital asset, you can choose which of the asset's parameters auto-select in the __Parameters__ pane of the asset's [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].

== Keep Channel List Selections == (keepselection)

When you select an object, you can choose to reset the channel list selection to its default state or keep the channel list selection in the state it was.

You can turn it on by setting the __Keep Channel List Selection__ animation preference [animation preference|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim] or on the playbar channel list refresh button's drop-down menu.

TIP:
    You can quickly switch between different objects in the Animation Editor without having to always reselect the channels you want to edit if you keep channel list selections.
