How do I set a key?:
    See [animation basics|basics].
    
How do I see or change what parameters are keyed?:
    See [Working with the Channel List|scope].
    
How do I change animation curves?:
    # [Add the parameter to the Channel List |scope].
    # Open the [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor].
    # Select a segment between two keys and use the function toolbar on the right side, or the function pop-up menu at the bottom right, to change the shape of the curve segment.
    
How do I move and scale keys?:
    - [In the channel graph|/ref/panes/changraph].
    - [In the dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet].
    - [On the timeline|playbar].

How do I make Houdini set keys automatically whenever I make a change?:
    See [auto-key preferences|autokey].

How do I edit the values on a keyframe without automatically changing the keyed values?:
    Turn off auto-commit. See [auto-key preferences|autokey].

How do I set up groups of channels so I can key them easily?:
    See [channel groups|channel_groups].

How do I set the frame rate of my animation?:
    # Click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] to open the [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts] window.
    # Edit the __FPS__ option.
    
    Note that changing the frames per second will change the number of frames to maintain the same time duration.

How do I make my animation more than 240 frames long?:
    # Click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] to open the [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts] window.
    # Edit the __End__ option, then click __Apply__.

How do I move the pivot point of an object?:
    # Select the object and press ((Ins)).
    # Use the handle to move the pivot point.
    # Press ((Ins)) again.

How do I move the handle away from the center of an object?:
    # Select the object and press ((')) (apostrophe).
    # Move the handle.
    # Press ((')) again.

    This does _not_ move the object's pivot point permanently -- it changes the position of the handle, which scales and rotates are relative to. So it has the same effect as moving the pivot point, but is more transitory, for when you want to scale or rotate relative to a certain point, but don't want to mess with the actual pivot.
