= Plasticity =

In Vellum when an object is bent or stretched, it returns to its original rest shape.  However, when plasticity effects are turned on, once an object is bent past a certain threshold it will maintain a new rest shape. Plasticity is typically used with Vellum Hair. For example, a character running it's hand through a character's fur, which stays matted down in that area.

There is an __Enable Plasticity__ checkbox on the [Vellum Constraints|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node, which will display a few __Plasticity__ parameters. The __Threshold__ determines the point at which the material will either return to it's original shape, or change into the new shape. The rate at which it changes to the new shape is determined by the __Rate__ parameter, which determines how fast the material adopts its new rest lengths. 

TIP:
    Turning on the visualization for __Stretch Plastic Flow__ or __Bend Plastic Flow__ is a useful way to see if the material is being affected by the plasticity constraints.
    
NOTE:
    It is difficult to make very stiff material in Vellum, such as sheet metal. For very hard materials, use [Bullet Soft Constraints|Node:dop/bulletsoftconrel].

The following video shows Crag walking through a field of grass, trampling down the grass (hairs) as he walks. The visualization at the top of the video shows the __Bend Plastic Flow__.
