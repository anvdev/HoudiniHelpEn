= Breaking and Tearing =

There is a new [Edge Fracture|Node:sop/edgefracture] tool provides an easy way to fracture a [Planar Patch|Node:sop/planarpatch] for vellum breaking and tearing.

The follow example demonstrates how to tear a simple piece of cloth.

# Create a [sphere|Node:sop/sphere] in the viewport.

# Raise it above the ground plane and set a keyframe at frame 0.

# Lower it below the ground plane and set a keyframe at frame 24.

# Create a [Planar Patch|Node:sop/planarpatch] and orient it in the ZX __Build Plane__.

# Increase the __Size__ and lower it below the sphere.
    
# Append an [Edge Fracture SOP|Node:sop/edgefracture] to [Planar Patch|Node:sop/planarpatch]. This will fracture the patch.

# Append a [Vellum Configure Cloth|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] to the [Edge Fracture|Node:sop/edgefracture] node. This will turn the patch into Vellum Cloth.

# In the __Pin to Animation__ selection, use the [Icon:BUTTONS/reselect] reselect button to interactively select points to pin in the viewport. Select 2 opposite edges by holding ((Shift)) and press ((Enter)).

# Wire the [Sphere SOP|Node:sop/sphere] into the collision geometry input of the [Vellum Configure Cloth|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] (third input).

# Append a [Vellum Solver|Node:sop/vellumsolver] after the [Vellum Configure Cloth|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node.

    If you play the simulation, the cloth will break apart at the fractures and fall since they are all cut apart.

# Add a [Vellum Weld Points SOP|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] between the [Vellum Configure Cloth|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] and [Vellum Solver|Node:sop/vellumsolver] nodes. This will weld your fractures together.

# Turn on the __Breaking__ checkbox and set the __Threshold__ at which you want the welds to break on the [Vellum Weld Points|Node:sop/vellumconstraints] node. The welds will break once the threshold is met.

NOTE:
    You can alternatively turn off __Initial Pieces__ on the [Edge Fracture SOP|Node:sop/edgefracture] and use the [Draw Curve|/shelf/drawcurve] tool on the __Create__ shelf to interactively draw the cuts in the [Planar Patch|Node:sop/planarpatch]. This gives you complete control of where the tears will occur. Wire the [Draw Curve|/shelf/drawcurve] node into the second input of the [Edge Fracture SOP|Node:sop/edgefracture] node to see the effects.
