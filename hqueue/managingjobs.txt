"""How to view and manage jobs on the farm."""


== How to ==

In a web browser, connect to the HQueue server (`http://<<hostname>>:5000/`). Click the [Image:/images/hqueue/jobs.svg] Jobs icon at the top-right corner of the web interface to go to the jobs page.

[Image:/images/hqueue/jobs_table.png]

TIP:
    Remote management from the web console uses SSH to connect to the client hosts. If remote management fails, make sure `sshd` (the SSH server process) is installed and running on the host, and that HQueue has the [correct username and password for the host|managingclients].

:task: Submit a job from Houdini:
    See [how to submit a job|submittingjobs].

:task: Submit a job using the [XML/RPC API|api]:

    You can create jobs using the API, as well as query information about running jobs, and manage jobs. See the [API documentation|api] for more information.

:task: View job details, including its child jobs:

    Click the Job ID in the job table.

:task: Reschedule any failed, abandoned, or canceled jobs:

    Click __Reschedule failed jobs__ below the job table.

:task: Pause, Cancel, or Reschedule a job:

    "Rescheduling" a job places the job back on the scheduling queue where it waits for an available client. Rescheduling a job also reschedules its parent jobs and any failed child jobs.

    # On the Jobs page, find the job in the list. Check the box at the start of the job row.

        (You can check multiple boxes to affect multiple jobs at once.)

    # Click the __Reschedule__ button below the job table.

:task: Pause or resume a job:

    # On the Jobs page, find the job you want to cancel in the list. Check the box at the start of the job row.

        (You can check multiple boxes to cancel multiple jobs at once.)

    # Click the __Cancel__ button below the job table.

    When a job is paused, it is halted on the assigned client machine.  The job remains in the scheduling queue where it waits for the user to either resume or cancel the job.  Pausing a job also pauses its child jobs.

    To resume a paused job, turn on the checkbox next to the paused job and then click the __Resume__ button below the job table.

:task: Cancel a job:

    # On the Jobs page, find the job you want to cancel in the list. Check the box at the start of the job row.

        (You can check multiple boxes to cancel multiple jobs at once.)

    # Click the __Cancel__ button below the job table.

:task: Delete any failed, abandoned, or canceled jobs:

    Click __Delete failed jobs__ below the job table.

:task: Delete an arbitrary job:

    When a job is deleted, it is *permanently removed* from the system.  Deleting a job also deletes its child jobs. You cannot delete jobs that have not completed.

    # On the Jobs page, find the job you want to delete in the list. Check the box at the start of the job row.

        (You can check multiple boxes to delete multiple jobs at once.)

    # Click the __Delete__ button below the job table.
