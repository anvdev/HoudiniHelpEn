"""Each client and job can have informational notes attached."""


== Overview ==

Each client and each job can track a threaded series of messages, called notes. Sometimes notes are automatically added to indicate status changes. You can manually add notes to remind yourself, or communicate to other administrators, information about clients or jobs.


== How to ==

In a web browser, connect to the HQueue server (`http://<<hostname>>:5000/`). Hover over the +(fa-bars) menu icon, then click *Notes*.

* To get the URL of a news feed of recent notes, right-click the +(fa-rss-square) feed icon and choose __Copy link__.

:task: Start a new message thread:

    On the notes page, click __Add note__.

:task: Delete a note:

    # On the Notes page, turn on the checkbox at the start of the note's row.

        (You can turn on multiple checkboxes to delete multiple notes at once.)

    # Click the __Delete selected__ button below the notes table.

:task: Delete all notes:

    Click the __Delete all__ button below the notes table.
