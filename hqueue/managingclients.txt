"""How to use the web interface or local logins to add, remove, restart, and manage client machines."""


== How to ==

In a web browser, connect to the HQueue server (`http://<<hostname>>:5000/`). Click the [Image:/images/hqueue/clients.svg] Clients icon at the top-right corner of the web interface to go to the clients page.

[Image:/images/hqueue/client_view.png]

TIP:
    Remote management from the web console uses SSH to connect to the client hosts. If remote management fails, make sure `sshd` (the SSH server process) is installed and running on the host, and that HQueue has the correct username and password for the host (see below).

:task: Add a client from the web interface:

    # On the Clients page, click __Add Clients__.
    
    # Set the __Platform__ to the OS of the new host machine, then click __Continue__.
    
    # On the next page:
        * Enter the hostname of the machine to be added in the __Machines__ field.

        * For the __Admin. Username__ and __Admin. Password__ fields, enter the username and password of an administrator account that exists on the machine.  *The client software does not need to run as admin*, however HQueue needs the administrator account to remotely log into the machine and install the HQueue Client.

    # Click __Add Machines__ and wait a few seconds.  The new host should appear in the client list.

    If adding the machine from the HQueue web interface fails with a "Connection Refused" error, refer to [this FAQ|/hqueue/faqs#connection_refused_add_client_linux].

:task: Set rules for when a client is available to the farm:

    You can have a situation where certain computers are used by people during work hours, but are added to the farm late at night. You can do this automatically using [availability rules|#availability].

    # On the Clients page, find the client you want to set the credentials for. Click the hostname to view the client details.

    # Under Availability, you can add, edit, disable, or delete rules.

        If *any* of the rules match current conditions, the server will consider the client available to accept jobs.

:task: Restart a client from the web interface:

    Currently you cannot restart Windows clients from the web console. See how to restart a client locally (below).

    # On the Clients page, find the client you want to restart in the client list. Check the box at the start of the row for that client.

    # Click the __Restart__ button below the client list.

        (You can check multiple boxes and then click __Restart__ if you want to restart multiple clients at once.)

:task: Set the username and password used to connect to a client machine:

    # On the Clients page, find the client you want to set the credentials for. Click the hostname to view the client details.

    # Under Client Details, click __Set username and password__.

:task: Restart a client when logged into the host machine:
    #id: restart_locally

    If you can connect to the host machine manually, you can restart the HQueue client locally.

    [Include:configuration#restart_locally/]

:task: Upgrade client software from the web interface:

    If a client is out-of-date, a "needs upgrade" message appears for it in the client list.

    # Check the box at the start of the row for any clients you need to upgrade.

    # Click the __Upgrade__ button below the client list.

:task: Remove clients using the web interface:

    *Important*: cancel any running jobs on the client before removing it from the client list.

    Currently you cannot remove Windows clients from the web console. See [how to uninstall the client on the host machine|uninstall].

    # On the Clients page, find the client you want to remove in the client list. Check the box at the start of the row for that client.

    # Click the __Remove__ button below the client list.

        (You can check multiple boxes and then click __Remove__ if you want to remove multiple clients at once.)

:task: Uninstall client software when logged into the host machine:

    See the [uninstalling page|uninstalling].


== Client list table ==

[Image:/images/hqueue/clients_table.png]

Column ||
    #width: 20%
    Description ||

<<checkboxes>> |
    Allows you to select a client. You can apply actions to selected client(s) using the buttons below the list. 

<<dots>> |

    The dot color indicates the client's status.

    <font style="color:#00CC33">+(fa-circle)</font> Green -- available
    
    <font style="color:#FF0000">+(fa-circle)</font> Red -- unavailable

Client |
    The host's DNS name and IP address.  Click the name to view the machine's profile.  If the client is out of date, the cell displays a "needs upgrade" message. 

Last Heartbeat |
    The number of seconds since the client machine last contacted the HQueue server.  If the client has never contacted the server, the cell displays a "no response" message. 

Platform |
    The host's operating system and architecture. 

CPUs |
    The number of processors on the host and their speeds. 

Memory |
    The total memory on the host. 

Load |
    A measure of how busy the machine is. The maximum load is equal to the number of CPUs. For example, a machine with 4 CPUs and a load of 4.0 means all CPUs are at 100% usage.

Idle Time |
    The number of minutes since the host received either a mouse or keyboard event from its primary user (macOS and Linux only). If you are have hosts in your farm that are used by people during work hours, this can give you a sense of whether the host is in use or available.

    For Linux hosts, the idle time is reported only if the client machine is configured to grant X11 display server access to the user account running the HQueue client daemon.  See the 'By Idle Time' subsection at [Client Availability Rules|#availability] for more details. 

Enabled |
    Whether the machine is allowed to receive jobs or not. 

<<note icon>> |
    Indicates whether the client has a note attached to it or not.

    [Icon:/images/hqueue/note.png]:
        Note exists. Hover over the icon to view the note. Click the icon to view the note's full thread.

    [Icon:/images/hqueue/add_note.png]:
        No note. Click the icon to add a note.

Availability |
    A list of rules controlling when the client will accept jobs.  See [Client Availability Rules|#availability].

== Client availability rules == (availability)

The availability of a client machines to take on jobs is determined by a set of rules.

This lets you create a situation where certain computers are used by people during the day, but are automatically added to the farm when nobody's using them.

[Image:/images/hqueue/client_availability_rules.png]

Currently there are two rule types:

By time:
    You can set the client to be available between certain hours (for example, from 11pm to 4am the next day on weeknights, all day on weekends).

    For a dedicated render server, you can turn on the __Anytime__ checkbox.

By idle time (Mac and Linux only):
    You can set the client to become available when it hasn't been used interactively for a certain number of minutes. This is only supported for Mac and Linux clients.

    NOTE:
        On Linux, the host must be configured to grant X11 display server access to the user account running the HQueue client. You can do this by logging into the host as the HQueue client user and running:

        {{{
        #!sh
        xhost +local:
        }}}

If you edit the rules, make sure to click __Save__ to save the new rules to the client.
