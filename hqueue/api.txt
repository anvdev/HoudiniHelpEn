"""You can connect to the HQueue server over the network and call functions to manipulate and query jobs and other information."""


== Overview ==

You can call functions on the Hqueue server through an XML/RPC[Fold:1] client (from the same machine or over the network). You can use the server's API to submit or query jobs.

:box:
    #fold: 1

    XML/RPC is a simple language-agnostic standard for translating function calls and return values into HTTP requests and responses. Python comes with a built-in XML/RPC client library, so you don't actually need to know anything about the protocol, it is simply the underlying technology that makes remote calls possible.

You can also connect and call functions on HQueue _clients_, however the API is [quite limited|#client].


== Connecting to the server ==

In Python you can connect to the server using the `xmlrpclib` client library. (XML/RPC clients are available in other languages, however we will limit ourselves to showing Python on this page.)

{{{
#!python
import xmlrpclib

# Connect to the HQueue server
hq = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://hq_server_hostname:5000")
}}}

The returned object acts as a proxy for the remote API: you can call function attributes on the object as if you were calling functions inside the remote HQueue server. See the [list of available functions|#functions_section] below.

If the connection is not valid, trying to call a function on the proxy will raise an exception:

{{{
#!python
try:
    hq.ping()
except:
    print("HQueue server is not working")
}}}

The following examples show how you call functions on the proxy object:

* Submit a new job:

    {{{
    #!python
    # Define a job which renders an image from an IFD using Mantra.
    job_spec = {
        "name": "Render My Image",
        "shell": "bash",
        "command": (
            "cd $HQROOT/houdini_distros/hfs;"
            " source houdini_setup;"
            " mantra < $HQROOT/path/to/ifds/some_frame.ifd"
        )
    }

    job_ids = hq.newjob(job_spec)
    }}}

* You can use the Job ID(s) returned by `newjob()` to query job progress using `getJob()`:

    {{{
    #!python
    job = hq_server.getJob(job_ids[0], ["progress", "status"])
    status = job["status"]

    print("The job status is", status)
    if status in hq.getRunningJobStatusNames():
        print("{:.2f}% complete".format(job["progress"] * 100.0))
    }}}


== Connecting to clients ==

HQueue clients also act as an XML/RPC API server. This allows you to call functions that force the client to send a heartbeat to the server, or cause the client to exit.

{{{
#!python
import xmlrpclib

# Connect to the HQueue client.
hq_client = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("http://hq_client_hostname:5001")
}}}

The client API has two functions:

`wakeup()`:
    Wake up the client if it is sleeping and force it to send a hearbeat to the server.

`terminate()`:
    Request the client to terminate. Terminating a client results in the following:

    * Any paused jobs on the client are cancelled.
    * New jobs cannot be assigned to the client.
    * Any jobs currently running on the client continue executing until they are complete.
    * The client is removed from the list of clients in the HQueue server.
    * Once all jobs on the client are finished, the client process exits.


@functions Server API


== Queue ==

::`runcmd(cmd)` -> `int`:
    Executes the given command on the HQueue farm.  This is accomplished by creating a new anonymous job with its `command` property set to <<cmd>>.  The job is assigned to a client machine and processed.
    
    Returns the id of the anonymous job.

::`getNumWaitingJobs(wait_time=0, min_priority=-1, max_priority=-1)` -> `int`:
    Returns the number of jobs that have been waiting for at least <<wait_time>> minutes.
    
    A waiting job is a job that is waiting for a resource; for example, an available client machine.
    
    If <<wait_time>> is 0 or negative, returns the total number of waiting jobs.

    If <<min_priority>> is greater than or equal to 0, then only jobs
    with priorities greater than or equal to <<min_priority>> are included
    in the returned number.  If it is less than 0 then there is no
    minimum priority restriction.

    If <<max_priority>> is greater than or equal to 0, then only jobs
    with priorities less than or equal to <<max_priority>> are included
    in the returned number.  If it is less than 0 then there is no
    maximum priority restriction.

::`getServerTime()` -> `xmlrpclib.DateTime`:
    Returns the current time reported by the HQueue server.  The time is in UTC.

::`getServerErrors()` -> `dict`:
    Returns the errors reported by the HQueue server. 
    
    The returned dictionary contains two keys: `total` and `errors`. `total` is the number of server errors, and `errors` is the list of errors (each error is a `dict`).
    
    Returns an empty `dict` if no error is reported.

::`getVersion()` -> `str`:
    Returns the HQueue server version.

::`ping()` -> `bool`:
    Test whether the HQueue server is active. Always returns True.


== Clients ==

::`getClients(client_ids=None, attribs=None)` -> `list` of `dict`:
    Returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the attributes for a client specified in <<client_ids>>.  
    
    <<client_ids>> must be a list of client id numbers. If it is not specified or is set to None, then attributes for all registered clients are returned.
    
    You can optionally set the <<attribs>> argument to a list of client attributes that will be returned.  This can help reduce the execution time of the function and also reduce the amount of data returned.
    
    Here is a list of client attributes:
    * `availabilityRules` - list of rules outlining the client's availability on the farm
    * `available` - whether the client is available to process jobs at the current time or not
    * `cpus` - number of cpus
    * `cpuSpeed` - processor speed
    * `description` - the client's description if set. An empty string is returned if no description is set for the client.
    * `disabled` - whether the client has been disabled on the farm or not
    * `groups` - list of group ids that the client is a member of
    * `hostname` - client machine name
    * `id` - client id
    * `idleTime` - number of minutes that the client has been idle (no activity from the logged-in user).  Only applies to workstations.  Is set to-1 if the idle time is unknown.
    * `ip` - client's IP address
    * `label` - client's display label. If the client has no `name` set, the label is the client's `hostname`. Otherwise the label is `hostname:name` where `hostname` and `name` are the client's hostname and name respectively.
    * `lastHeartbeat` - time when the client last contacted the server.  The time is in UTC.
    * `latestNote` - the text of the latest note from the thread corresponding to the client. An empty string is returned if there is no corresponding thread.
    * `load` - client load
    * `memory` - amount of physical memory in kilobytes
    * `name` - the name of the client if a name has been specified in the client's `hqnode.ini` file. By default this is empty (i.e. `""`).
    * `needsUpgrade`    - whether the client's code is out-of-date and requires an update
    * `platform` - client's operating system and architecture
    * `runningJobs` - ids for the jobs currently running on the client

::`getClientsByName(clientnames, attribs=None)` -> `list` of `dict`:
    Convenience function for getClients(). Returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the attributes for a client specified by a clientname in <<clientnames>>.

    <<clientnames>> must be a list of clientnames. You can list clientnames in the `hostname` format to specify a client by hostname,
    or in the `hostname:name` format to refer to a client with the specified `hostname` and `name`.

::`getClientErrors(client_id)` -> `dict`:
    Returns the errors reported by the a client specified in <<client_ids>>. 
    
    The returned dictionary contains two keys: `total` and `errors`. `total` is the number of client errors, and `errors` is the list of errors (each error is a `dict`).

== Job queries ==

::`getJobs(job_ids, attribs=None)` -> `list` of `dict`:
    Returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the attributes for a job specified in <<job_ids>>. 
    
    <<job_ids>> must be a list of job id numbers.
    
    You can optionally set the <<attribs>> argument to a list of job attributes that will be returned.  This can help reduce the execution time of the function and also reduce the amount of data returned.
    
    Here is a list of job attributes:
    * `children` - list of child job ids
    * `clients` - list of clients that are executing or have executed the job
    * `clientsOnHold` - list of clients that are on hold (or reserved) for the job.  Clients can be held for  a job if the job requires multiple clients to execute but only some clients are available at the moment.  Once the job has enough clients on-hold, then those clients are assigned to the job.
    * `conditions` - list of scheduling conditions imposed on the job
    * `endTime` - time when the job ended.  The time is in UTC.  Is set to `None` if the job has not finished.
    * `ETA` - estimated number of seconds before the job is finished.  Is set to -1 if the ETA cannot be determined.  Note that calculation of this attribute requires HQueue to query the job and all of its descendents which can significantly slow down the performance of `getJobs`.
    * `id` - job id
    * `latestNote` - the text of the latest note for the thread associated with the job. An empty string is returned if there is no such thread.
    * `logs` - list of entries for the job's status change log
    * `name` - job name
    * `overallProgress` - overall progress percentage (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the job and its descendents.  Note that calculation of this attribute requires HQueue to query the job and all of its descendents which can significantly slow down the performance of `getJobs`.
    * `parents` - list of parent job ids
    * `priority` - job priority
    * `progress` - progress percentage (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the job command.  If the job has no command to execute, then the progress will always be set to 0.0.
    * `queueTime` - time when the job was submitted, or queued, in HQueue.  The time is in UTC.
    * `resources` - dictionary of the resources a job requires. Each key is a resource name and value is the amount of the respective resource the job requires. `None` is returned if the job does not require any resources. See [Resources|resourcedetails] for more information on job resources.
    * `showBlockedClientsWarning` - a boolean flag indicating whether a warning icon will be displayed in the status column of the Running Jobs table on the Jobs page for the job. Clicking on the icon will show a dialog with information about the job's blocked clients.
    * `startTime` - time when the job or one of its descedents started.  The time is in UTC.
    * `status` - internal job status.  HQueue queries only the job itself (and not its descendents) so requesting this attribute is extremely fast.  If you are interested only in whether a job is finished or not, then request for this attribute instead of _uiStatus_.  Possible values of this attribute are _abandoned_, _cancelled_, _failed_, _paused_, _pausing_, _resuming_, _running_, _succeeded_, _runnable_ and _queued_.  _runnable_ is the equivalent of the _waiting for machine_ UI status.  _queued_ indicates that the job is waiting for descedent jobs to finish before it can run.
    * `tags` - list of tags, or custom properties, attached to the job.  Of note, the _single_ tag indicates that the job can only run on a machine that has no other jobs running on it.
    * `threadId` - the id of the thread associated with the job. `None` is returned if there is no such thread.
    * `triesLeft` - the number of times the job will attempt to run after a failure. For example, if a job has a `triesLeft` of 2 and it fails after running, it will automatically be rescheduled and queued, and its `triesLeft` will be decremented and set to 1.
    * `uiStatus` - job status which appears in the HQueue web interface.  A list of the possible UI job statuses is listed at [Job Statuses|jobdetails#statuses].  Note that this attribute requires HQueue to query the job and all of its descendents which can significantly slow down the performance of `getJobs`.
    * `waitingFor` - the reason why the job is waiting if available. An empty string is returned if the job is not waiting or if the reason is not available.
