"""How to set configuration options for the HQueue server and clients."""


== Server configuration ==

The HQueue server uses a configuration file in `/opt/hqueue/hqserver.ini` on the server machine. You can edit this file and restart the HQueue server to change how HQueue works.

:box:
    #id: restart_locally
    
    :platform:Linux:
        To restart the server on Linux, run:

        {{{
        #!sh
        cd /opt/hqueue
        ./scripts/hqserverd restart
        }}}

    :platform:Mac:
        To restart the server On macOS, run:

        {{{
        #!sh
        launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sidefx.hqserver.plist
        launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sidefx.hqserver.plis
        }}}

    :platform:Windows:
        To restart the server on Windows, go to __Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services__ and restart the `HQueueServer` service.

TIP:
    If you use the string `%(here)s` in a value, it will be replaced with the path of the directory containing the `hqserver.ini` file. You can use this to specify paths relative to the configuration file location.

Name ||
    Description ||

`debug` |
    Set to `true` to output debugging information into the server logs (see [Logging|logging]). 

`email_to` |
    The email address that receives messages when a system error or notification occurs.  `smtp_server` must also be set. 

`error_email_from` |
    The email address that sends messages when a system error or notification occurs.  `smtp_server` must also be set. 

`hqserver.activeTimeout` |
    The number of minutes that pass before a client machine is marked as 'not responding'. 

`hqserver.expireJobsDays` |
    The number of days that pass before a finished job is permanently deleted from HQueue. 

`hqserver.port` |
    The port number that the HQueue server listens on.  This variable must have the same value as `port`. 

`hqserver.sharedNetwork.host` |
    The machine hosting the shared network drive. 

`hqserver.sharedNetwork.mount.linux` |
    The mount point to the shared network drive on a Linux client machine. 

`hqserver.sharedNetwork.mount.macosx` |
    The mount point to the shared network drive on a macOS client machine. 

`hqserver.sharedNetwork.mount.windows` |
    The mount point to the shared network drive on a Windows client machine. 

`hqserver.sharedNetwork.path` |
    The folder path to the shared network drive on the host machine. 

`hqserver.upgradePriority` |
    The priority setting for the built-in "Upgrade" jobs. 

`job_logs_dir` |
    The folder where job logs are saved to. 

`port` |
    The port number that the HQueue server listens on.  This variable must have the same value as `hqserver.port`. 

`smtp_server` |
    The mail server that delivers messages when a system error or notification occurs. 

`sqlalchemy.default.pool_size` |
    The maximum number of database connections available in the connection pool.  If you see "QueuePool limit of size" errors in the server log, then you need to increase the value of this variable.  As a general rule of thumb, set `pool_size` equal to roughly the number of client machines on the farm. 

`sqlalchemy.default.max_overflow` |
    The maximum number of database connections to create in excess of the value defined in `sqlalchemy.default.pool_size`.  This variable takes effect only during peak periods when the number of connections required exceeds the maximum pool size. 


== Client configuration ==

The HQueue client uses a configuration file named `hqnode.ini` in the client installation directory. You can edit this file and restart the client to change how the client works.

:platform:Linux:
    To restart the client on Linux, run:

    {{{
    #!bash
    cd <install_dir>
    ./hqclientd restart
    }}}

:platform:Mac:
    To restart the client On macOS, run:

    {{{
    #!bash
    launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sidefx.hqclient.plist
    launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sidefx.hqclient.plist
    }}}

:platform:Windows:
    To restart the client on Windows, go to __Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services__ and restart the `HQueueClient` service.


=== Values ===

Name ||
    Description ||

`sharedNetwork.mount` |
    The mount point to the shared network drive on the client.

`server` |
    The HQueue server the client should connect to. If this is set, the `port` must also be set to the server's port.

`port` |
    The port number that the HQueue server listens on.

`name` |
    The name for the client. This is only needed if you are planning to run multiple clients on the same machine. If you wish to run multiple clients on the same machine, ensure each client is launched from separate installation directories and configure each client's `hqnode.ini` file to have a unique, non-empty name.

`cpus` |
    The number of cpus available to the client for running jobs.

`auto_upgrade` |
    Controls whether the client should automatically upgrade on start up if an upgrade is available. Set this to `0` to disable automatic upgrade, set it to `1` to enable automatic upgrade (default).
