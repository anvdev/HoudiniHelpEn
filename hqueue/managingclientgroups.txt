"""How to use the web interface or local logins to create and manage groups of client machines."""


== Overview ==

Client groups let you give a collection of client machines a name. This lets you easily assign a job to just the machines in a certain group.

For example, you might set up a `bigiron` group for render servers that have very large amounts of memory. Then if you have huge simulation jobs you could assign them to only run on the `bigiron` machines.

A client machine can be a member of multiple groups at once.


== How to ==

In a web browser, connect to the HQueue server (`http://<<hostname>>:5000/`). Hover over the +(fa-bars) menu icon, then click *Groups*.
