= Snapping, construction plane, and alignment =


== Grids ==

Houdini has two grids: the _reference plane_ which helps you orient yourself in 3D space, and the _construction plane_ which tools place things relative to.


=== Reference plane ===

The default infinite XZ grid shown in the viewer is the _reference plane_.

[Image:/images/ui/reference_grid.jpg]

:task: Show or hide the reference plane:
    Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view).

:task: Customize the reference plane grid:
    Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view) and choose __Reference plane parameters__.
    
    See the [reference grid parameters|#grid_parms] below.

    TIP:
        You can set the __Ruler type__ directly from the right-click menu on the icon.


=== Construction plane === (cplane)

Many modeling operations, such as creating a new objects using the tools in the Create shelf tab and drawing curves, are relative to the _construction plane_.

The default construction plane is the same as the reference plane (an XZ grid centered on the origin).

You can change the display of the grid on the construction plane, or move/reorient the construction plane to make it easier to model in an area not centered on the origin, or in a space other than the XZ ground plane.


TIP:
    When you're using the construction plane, you might also want to turn off the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] reference plane to avoid confusion.

:task: Show or hide the construction plane:
    Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display construction plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view).

:task: Show or hide the construction plane handle:
    The construction plane handle lets you position, rotate, and align the construction plane interactively in the viewer.

    # Do one of the following:

        * Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display Construction Plane button in the display toolbar to the right of the viewer and turn on __Construction Plane Handle__.

        * Tap [/|Key:h.pane.gview.state.volatile_floor] to toggle the handle on or off.

        * Hold [/|Key:h.pane.gview.state.volatile_floor] to show the handle, interact with it, then release the key to hide the handle again.

    # Use the handle at the center to move or rotate the construction plane.

        [Image:/images/model/aids_cplane_handle.jpg]

    TIP:
        The construction plane extends to infinity. However, you can resize the _visual_ indication of the construction plane by dragging the handles at the corners.

        [Image:/images/model/aids_resize_cplane.jpg]

:task: Align the construction plane to geometry:
    With construction plane handle shown (see above), click a component (face, edge, or point) to snap the construction plane to the component and align construction plane's normal with the component's normal.

    [Image:/images/model/aids_align_cplane.jpg]

    TIP:
        You can quickly align the construction plane as you work using the sticky construction plane handle key. For example, press and hold [/|Key:h.pane.gview.state.volatile_floor], click a face to align the construction plane to it, then release the key.

:task: Set the construction plane perpendicular to the current viewing direction:
    Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display Construction Plane button in the display toolbar to the right of the viewer and choose __Set construction plane > Align c-plane with viewing plane__.

:task: Customize the construction plane grid:
    Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view) and choose __Construction plane parameters__. See the [grid parameters|#grid_parms] below.

:task: Return the construction plane to the default:
     Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display Construction Plane button in the display toolbar to the right of the viewer and choose __Set construction plane > Revert to defaults__.


=== Grid parameters === (grid_parms)

Grid spacing:
    How far apart (in Houdini units) to draw the grid lines.

Grid ruler:
    Show numbers on the axes at these intervals. For example, `5` means show numbers on the grid at 5, 10, 15, and so on. See also the __Ruler type__ option below.

Origin:
    Center the grid plane around this point (in world units). An easier way to position the construction plane is to use its handle (see above).

Rotation:
   Specifies the orientation of the grid plane.

Ruler type:
    No ruler:
        Don't show numbers on the grid.
    
    Ruler on main axis:
        Show numbers on the vertical and horizontal axes.
    
    Ruler on grid points:
        Show numbers across the entire grid.


== Quick-views and quick-planes ==

Similar to [quickmarks|/network/navigate#quick] in the network editor, you can store and recall a few commonly-used views, and a few construction planes, and switch between them easily using hotkeys.

:task: Save a view:
    Hold ((Space)) to enter the view tool, then press ((Ctrl)) and ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).
    
    (On +(fa-apple) Mac, press ((Cmd)) and ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).)
    
:task: Return to a quick view:
    Hold ((Space)) to enter the view tool, then press ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).

:task: Save a construction plane:
    Tap [/|Key:h.pane.gview.state.volatile_floor] to enter theconstruction plane state, then press ((Ctrl)) and ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).
    
    (On +(fa-apple) Mac, press ((Cmd)) and ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).)
    
:task: Return to a construction plane:
    Hold [/|Key:h.pane.gview.state.volatile_floor] to enter the construction plane state, then press ((6)), ((7)), ((8)), or ((9)).

NOTE:
    Saving a quick view saves _everything_ about the view at that moment, including display options such as whether points are displayed, what guides are visible, and the shading mode.


== Snapping ==


    Use the snapping icons in the toolbox (one the left side of the viewer pane) to turn snapping on and off.

    Right-click, or press and hold, an icon to see a menu of options.

    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_grid] Snap to grid:
        Snap to points on the construction plane.
    
    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_curve] Snap to primitives:
        Snap to curves and edges.
    
    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_point] Snap to points:
        Snaps to points.

    [Icon:TOOLS/snap] Multi-snap:
        Snap to different things simultaneously. Right-click to open the options menu and choose __Multi-snapping options__ to set priorities for individual types of snapping.


=== Options menu ===

:fig:[Image:/images/ui/snapping_menu.png]
    Templates:
        At the [Geometry level|/basics/objects], you can snap to [templated geometry|/nodes/sop/] (geometry that is made visible for reference purposes, using the template flag).
        
    Other objects:
        At the [Geometry level|/basics/objects], you can snap to geometry from _other objects_, not just the object you are inside.

    X-ray geometry:
        At the Object level, you can snap to geometry in objects with the [X-ray flag|/network/flags#obj] set.

    Occlusion:
        Prevents snapping to geometry hidden (occluded) behind shaded surfaces. When Occlusion is on, you can only snap to visible geometry.

    Depth snapping:
        If you turn this option off, you can snap to reference geometry, but the point stays on the construction plane.

    Interior snapping:
        Snap to the midline of enclosing geometry under the cursor.

    Orient on snap:
        When you snap one object to another, normally the orientation of the object will remain the same and only its location will change. If this option is turned on, the object will rotate according to the preference set in the [snapping options window|/ref/windows/snapoptions].  The default is to rotate so the closest major axis (x, y, z) points in the direction of the thing you are snapping to.
        
    Multi-snapping options:
        Open the [snapping options window|/ref/windows/snapoptions] containing additional options. For multi-snapping, this window lets you give each type of snapping different priorities so, for example, snapping to points overrides snapping to edges.


== Align handles to geometry == (align)
#index: document
#bestbet: align

In many Houdini tools, viewer handles let you interactively edit parameter values in the viewer, such as the Transform and Rotate handles that let you position and rotate objects.

Often you want to position and/or rotate those handles based on existing geometry. For example, you might want to position a cube object's pivot at one of its corners. You can use the alignment state/hotkey to align handles with geometry.

TIP:
    The [Align Components shelf tool|/shelf/matchtransform] provides a higher-level workflow for aligning geometry to geometry.

:task: Switch to align state:
    Do one of the following:

    * Right-click the handle and choose __Align handle > Start orientation picking__.

    * Tap [;|Key:h.pane.gview.handle.xform.click_orient] to toggle the align state on or off.

    * Hold [;|Key:h.pane.gview.handle.xform.click_orient] to show the align state, interact with it, then release the key to exit alignment mode.

    Unless you hold the key, once you align the handle Houdini will automatically exit the align state.

:task: Align a handle to geometry:
    
    You can align a handle to the position and/or normal of a face, edge, or point.

    # Enter the align state (see above).

        [Image:/images/model/aids_align_before.jpg]

        Houdini highlights points, edges, and face normals as you move the mouse pointer.

    # Click the face, edge, or point you want to align to.

        :col:
            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_face.jpg]
                """Aligned with front face"""
        :col:
            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_edge.jpg]
                """Aligned with edge"""
        :col:
            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_point.jpg]
                """Aligned with corner point"""

        Different modifier keys perform different operations:

        Click the geometry to *move and rotate* the handle to its position |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_face.jpg]
                """Moved to front face, aligned with front face normal."""
    
        ((Shift + LMB)) to *rotate* the handle to align with the face/edge/point normal (the handle does not move) |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_rotate_only.jpg]
                """Aligned with front face normal only."""
    
        ((Ctrl + LMB)) to *move* the object without rotating |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_move_only.jpg]
                """Moved to front face without aligning."""
    
        ((Shift + Ctrl + LMB)) to rotate the handle to *point at* the geometry (the handle does not move) |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_align_lookat.jpg]
                """"Look at" front face."""

:task: Set the alignment axis:
    By default, Houdini aligns along the "up" axis (+Y in the default settings). You can set a _primary axis_ to control which axis Houdini uses when you align the handle to geometry.

    # Enter the align state (see above).

    # ((Ctrl))-click one of the rectanglar axis alignment handles. The rectangle becomes pointy to show it is now the primary axis.

        :col:
            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_orient_handles.jpg]
                """Ctrl-click Z orientation handle..."""
        :col:
            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_orient_handles_primary.jpg]
                """...to make it the primary axis."""

    # Now when you align to geometry (see above), it will align along the axis you set as primary.

        [Image:/images/model/aids_align_edge_primary_z.jpg]

:task: Orient the handle based on geometry:

    This procedure orients the handle based on some existing geometry. It does _not_ move the handle.
    
    # Enter the align state (see above).

    # Click one of the rectangular axis alignment handles.

        The rectangle turns yellow to show it is selected.

        [Image:/images/model/aids_orient_handles_selected.jpg]

    # Click a face, edge, or point. Different component types cause different types of orienation:

        Click a *face* to orient the selected axis *along the face's normal* |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_orient_z_to_top.jpg]
                """Oriented the Z axis to the normal of the top face."""

        Click an *edge* to orient the selected axis *along the edge direction* |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_orient_y_to_front_edge.jpg]
                """Oriented the Y axis along the front edge."""

        Click a *point* to orient the selected axis *toward the point position* |

            :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_orient_y_to_corner_point.jpg]
                """Oriented the Y axis toward the corner point."""

:task: Do secondary orienation:
    
    After you orient the handle along one axis (see above), you can "lock" that axis orientation and try to orient the other two axes based on other geometry.

    TIP:
        This procedure involves multiple steps in the handle align state. If you enter the align state using the context menu or by tapping the key, the state will end after the do the primary orientation, and you will need to re-enter the state to do the secondary orientation. Or, you can perform both orientation steps while _holding_ the state key.

    # Enter the align state and orient the handle based on some geometry (see above).

        :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_2nd_primary_z_front_face.jpg]

    # ((Ctrl))-click the rectangular axis alignment handle to lock it as the _primary_ axis. The rectangle becomes pointy to show it is now the primary axis.

        :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_2nd_lock_z_select_x.jpg]

    # Click a face, edge, or point to orient the other two axes.

        :fig:[Image:/images/model/aids_2nd_orient_x_front_corner.jpg]

    NOTE:
        It may not always be possible to accomplish the secondary orientation if it conflicts with the locked primary axis orientation.

:task: Align a handle with the construction plane:
    Right click the handle and choose __Align handle > C-plane axes__.
