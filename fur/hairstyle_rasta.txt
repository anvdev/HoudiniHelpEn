= How to |> create hair styled like dreadlocks =

== Basic hair setup ==

# Create a sphere at the origin by ((Ctrl+LMB)) clicking the [Icon:SOP/sphere][Sphere|/shelf/sphere] on the __Create__ shelf tab.

# Dive into the sphere object and set __Rows__ and __Columns__ to `50` to get a rounder sphere.

# Add hair to the sphere using the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool on the __Hair__ shelf tab.

# On the Fur object, set __Length__ to `0.6`.

You will see the default hair look now. The guide hairs are sticking out straight, and each generated hair is a blend between multiple guides in it's neighborhood.

== Render setup ==

To get a better look at the hair, set up a quick render.

# Rotate the viewport so you are looking straight down onto the sphere.

# ((Ctrl+LMB)) click the [Area Light|/shelf/arealight] tool on the [Lights and Cameras|/shelf/lightsandcameras] shelf tab. This will create the light in your viewing position.

# Rotate the viewport back to look straight at the sphere.

# Switch to the [Render View|/ref/views/ipr] and click __Render__.

You should get something like this:

NOTE:
        As you work through this how-to, you should be able to see the effect of your changes in the [Scene Viewer|/basics/view], but it can be a good idea to perform additional test renders as you go along.

== Turn guides into thick hair strands ==

For dreadlocks, you want to have each hair follow the guide that's closest to it, so you get a thick strand of many hairs around each guide.

To achieve this, you can use a `clusterid` attribute. Hair is not interpolated between guides with different `clusterid`s, so if you assign each hair it's own `clusterid`, you should get the desired effect.

# Dive into the fur object > guides node.

# Attach a [Icon:SOP/attribwrangle][Primitive Wrangle|/nodes/sop/attribwrangle] to the `INPUT_GUIDES` node, making sure it's [display flag|/nodes/sop/] is set.

# Set the __VEXpression__ parameter to `i@clusterid = @primnum;`. This will put each primitive's index (`@primnum`) into it's `clusterid` attribute (`i@clusterid`), so each primitive will have a different value.

# Go to the __Guides__ tab on the [fur object|Node:obj/fur] and reduce the __Density__ to around `50`, to get fewer and thicker strands.

Here's what you should get after these adjustments:

== Tighten the strands ==

Get the hairs of each strand to pull closer to their guide.

#  Go to the __Appearance > Clump__ tab on the [fur object|Node:obj/fur].

# Turn on __Clump Fur__.

# Set __Density__ to `50,` to match the guides.

# Set __Clump Geo Source__ to __Use Guide Curves__. This will reuse the guide curves for clumping.

# Set the curve to something like the screenshot below. This will make the hairs quickly move towards the guide and then continue straight.

# You can now control the overall effect using __Tightness__. The default of `0.5` moves the hair points halfway towards the guide. If you set `1.0` here, the hair will move all the way to the guide, resulting in a very thin strand.

# On the __Basic__ tab, increase __Segments__ to `20`.

    NOTE:
        This is necessary because, with the default of `4`, the hair curves don't have enough segments to represent the steep ramp you used above, The extra segments will also be helpful to set up frizz with a high frequency.

== Add Frizz ==

Use frizz to get rid of the perfectly straight look.

# Go to __Appearance > Frizz__ on the [fur object|Node:obj/fur] and set __Maximum Frizz__ to `0.25`.

# Set __Frequency__ to `20`.

    NOTE:
        Remember that you increased the number of hair segments in the previous section. Without this, you wouldn't have enough points in the hair curves to represent the high frequency noise.
        
# Set the ramp to something like this, to get frizz all along the hair:

    NOTE:
        Alternatively you can ignore the ramp and set both __Minimum Frizz__ and __Maximum Frizz__ to `0.25`.

== Shader Settings ==

# Navigate to the hair shader inside the fur object (Located in `fur/shopnet1/textured_hair`).

    NOTE:
        As a shortcut, you can ((LMB)) the arrow next to the __Material__ parameter on the Fur object's __Basic__ tab.

        Use ((Ctrl+LMB)) to open the shader parameters in a new window.

# Reduce the hair's reflectiveness by reducing __Intensity__ on the __Reflection__ tab to `0.02`.

# Turn on __Randomize__ for __Diffuse Saturation__ and __Diffuse Intensity__ on the __Randomness Tab__.

# You can use the ramps to create a few bright gray hairs. Set up the ramps according to the screenshot below.

[Image:/images/howto/hair_rasta_randomness.png]

NOTE:
    The random saturation and intensity values are picked from the __Source Values__ ramps. You're setting 80% of hairs to have high saturation, and about 20% to have low saturation. You're setting 80% of the hair to have a dark color, and 20% to have a bright color.
    
    __Important__: You're using the same seed for both ramps. This means that for each hair, the position along each ramp will be the same. In other words, a hair that is desaturated will also be bright.

To style the hair, use the tools on the [Grooming Shelf|/shelf/guidebrushes] shelf tab.
