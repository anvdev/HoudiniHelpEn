You can use masks to control various attributes when grooming. For example, if you have a more realistic character, such as an animal, you can control the length of fur around the face, ears, and feet by painting on the mesh.

Once you have a piece of geometry, you can create fur by using the [Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool on the __Hair Utils__ shelf. Next you can use the [Initialize Guides|/shelf/sop_groom_guideinit] tool on the __Guide Process__ tab to set the direction of the fur, which is necessary when styling the fur to ensure predictable results.

The [Set Guide Length|/shelf/sop_groom_guideprocess_length] tool will allow you to control the length of the coat, as well as paint areas where you don't want fur.

Using the __Length__ parameter dropdown menu, select __Skin Attribute__ and click the [Icon:SOP/paint] button below to interactively paint the areas where you don't want fur in the viewport.

NOTE:
    By default, symmetry on the brush is turned on. To disable this, go to the __Symmetry__ tab and uncheck the __Reflective__ parameter.
