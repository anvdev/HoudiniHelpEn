"""Returns the data id of a geometry attribute."""

:usage:`int [] attribdataid(<geometry>, string attribclass, string attribute_name)`

    Returns the data id corresponding to an attribute.  Data ids can
    be used for advanced forms of caching.  If the data id of an attribute
    is the same as you've seen before, you can assume the attribute
    contains the same data it did before.  This allows acceleration
    structures to only be built when necessary.

    The length and contents of the array are not defined, and no assumptions
    should be made about the layout.  The result will vary from run
    to run of Houdini, so only exact equality should be used.

    In addition to the normal attribute classes, an additional
    attribute class of "meta" is supported.  This has the additional
    data ids of:

	topology:
	    The overall wiring of vertices, points and primitives.
	    This will change if any points are rewired or vertices
	    added.
	primitivelist:
	    This data id changes if the contents of the primitive
	    change at all.
	detail:
	    This data id tracks the entire geometry as a whole.  If
	    it is unchanged, no changes occurred in the geometry.

:returns:

    An integer array indicating the data id of the attribute.
