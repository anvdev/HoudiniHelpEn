"""Finds the distance of a point to a group of points along the surface of a geometry."""

:usage: `float surfacedist(<geometry>; string ptgroup; string P_attribute; int search_pt; float max_radius; int &closest_pt; string distance_metric)`

Returns the distance from the search point to the closest point in the point
group.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:ptgroup:
    The name of a point group or a pattern to generate a point
    group.  Uses the same semantics as a SOP group, so empty strings
    will match all points.  Attribute groups like `@Cd.x>0` can
    also be used, but note that the `@` may need to be escaped with
    a backslash in a [Snippet VOP|Node:vop/snippet].

:arg:P_attribrute:
    The name of the vector attribute to use to measure distance between
    connected points. Using "P" will give the world distance along the surface,
    but a custom attribute can be used to measure along a different metric.

:arg:search_pt:
    The point to measure the distance for.

:arg:max_radius:
    The maximum distance to measure the surface distance.  This can speed things
    up by allowing the search to quit early if the point is not within the
    radius. Points outside the radius will return a value of `-1` for both the
    distance and the lead point.

:arg:&closest_pt:
    Index of the closest point in the source group.

    `-1` if no closest point was found.

:arg:distance_metric:
    The method to use to measure distance. Accepted values are `edge` and
    `surface`. Edge distance is measured along the edges of the model, while
    surface distance is measured along edges and across single polygons. Surface
    distance is a better approximation of the true geodesic distance, but is
    also more expensive to compute.

:returns:
    The distance from the search point to the closest point in the point group.

    Returns `-1` if no closest point was found.
