"""Applies a full-body inverse kinematics algorithm to a skeleton."""

:usage: `matrix[] solvefbik(matrix xforms[], int parents[], int targets[], matrix targetxforms[], int iters)`
:usage: `matrix[] solvefbik(matrix xforms[], int parents[], int targets[], matrix targetxforms[], int iters, float tolerance, int pinroot)`
:usage: `matrix[] solvefbik(matrix xforms[], int parents[], int targets[], matrix targetxforms[], int iters, float tolerance, int pinroot, float targetweights[], int targetpriorities[], int targetdepths[])`
:usage: `matrix[] solvefbik(matrix xforms[], int parents[], int targets[], matrix targetxforms[], int iters, float tolerance, int pinroot, float targetweights[], int targetpriorities[], int targetdepths[], matrix goalxforms[], vector4 constrainedxforms[], vector jointlimits[])`

Returns an empty array if:
- `xforms` is not the same size as `parents`
- `targets` is not the same size as `targetxforms`
- The `goalxforms`, `constrainedxforms`, and `jointlimits` arrays aren't empty, but are not the same size as `xforms`

The `goalxforms`, `constrainedxforms`, and `jointlimits` parameters should be in the form produced by the [Agent Configure Joints SOP|/nodes/sop/agentconfigurejoints].

:arg:xforms:
    The world transforms of all the transforms in the rig being solved.

:arg:parents:
    The parent transform index for each transform.  A value of -1 indicates a root.

:arg:targets:
    A list of the transform indices of the end effectors in the skeleton.

:arg:targetxforms:
    A list of the target transforms for the end effectors, in the same order as `targets`.

:arg:goalxforms:
    Part of the joint constraints as produced by [Agent Configure Joints|/nodes/sop/agentconfigurejoints].
    An empty array indicates no joint constraints.

:arg:constrainedxforms:
    Part of the joint constraints as produced by [Agent Configure Joints|/nodes/sop/agentconfigurejoints].
    An empty array indicates no joint constraints.

:arg:jointlimits:
    Part of the joint constraints as produced by [Agent Configure Joints|/nodes/sop/agentconfigurejoints].
    An empty array indicates no joint constraints.
