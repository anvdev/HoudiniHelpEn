[Include:_common#geohandle_arg]

:arg:point_number:
    If this is `-1`, the function has no effect.

:arg:and_prims: 
    If this is `1`, the function deletes any _degenerate_ primitives that referred to the removed point (for example, closed polygons with fewer than 3 vertices or open polygons with fewer than 2 vertices).
    
    If this is `0`, the function only deletes primitives that become invalid because of the removed point (for example, tetrahedra with fewer than 4 vertices, or volumes with zero vertices).
