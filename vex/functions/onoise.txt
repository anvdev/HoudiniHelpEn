These functions are similar to [wnoise|Vex:wnoise] and
[vnoise|Vex:vnoise]. However, they are marginally less efficient in
computation and don't have the same characteristics. The bounds on the
noise are roughly (-1, 1). Only 3D noise is supported. However, this
noise has the ability to compute turbulence with roughness and
attenuation on the noise.
