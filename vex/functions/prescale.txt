"""Prescales the given matrix in three directions simultaneously (X, Y, Z -
given by the components of the scale_vector)."""

:usage: `void prescale(matrix &m, vector scale_vector)`
:usage: `void prescale(matrix3 &m, vector scale_vector)`

    Prescales the matrix in three directions simultaneously by the factors in the vector.
    This modifies the matrix in-place, rather than returning a new matrix.
