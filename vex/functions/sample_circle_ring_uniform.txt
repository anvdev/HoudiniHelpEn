"""Generates a uniform vector2 with alpha < length < 1, where 0 < alpha < 1, given a vector2 of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector2 sample_circle_ring_uniform(vector2 u, float alpha)`

:arg:u:
    Pair of numbers between 0 and 1.

:arg:alpha:
    The inner radius to be bounded by. A number between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector2 of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` pairs of values in [0,1), and value `alpha` in [0,1], the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit circle ring with inner radius of `alpha`.
Specifically, it returns `scale*(cos(angle),sin(angle))`, where `angle` is `2*pi*u.x`
and `scale` is `sqrt((1-alpha^2)*u.y+alpha^2)`.
