"""Finds the normal component of frame slid along a curve. """

:usage: `vector slideframe(const vector x0, const vector t0, const vector n0, const vector x1, const vector t1)`

Given two points `x0` and `x1` with respective tangent vectors `t0` and `t1` along a curve, as well as the curve normal `n0` at the first point, this function returns the minimum rotation transfer of `n0` to the second point.

You use this function to extend a curve normal at the starting point of a curve to the entire curve in a rotation minimizing fashion.
