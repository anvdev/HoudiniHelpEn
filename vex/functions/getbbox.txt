"""Sets two vectors to the minimum and maximum corners of the bounding box for the geometry."""

:usage: `void getbbox(<geometry>, vector &min, vector &max)`

    Sets the vectors to the minimum and maximum corners of the bounding box
    for the geometry.  This outputs the primitive bounding box, which includes
    the extents of spheres and volumes.

:usage: `void getbbox(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector &min, vector &max)`

    Outputs the bounding box of the primitive in the given group.
    An empty <<primgroup>> string will include all primitives.
    The string supports Ad-hoc patterns like `0-10` and `@Cd.x>0`.

:usage: `void getbbox(vector &min, vector &max)`

    WARNING:
        This form of `getbbox` is deprecated and may be removed in the future. 
        Use the other forms as needed.
