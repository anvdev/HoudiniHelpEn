"""Generates a uniform vector with alpha < length < 1, where 0 < alpha < 1, given a vector of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector sample_sphere_shell_uniform(vector u, float alpha)`

:arg:u:
    Three numbers between 0 and 1.

:arg:alpha:
    The inner radius to be bounded by. A number between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of three values in [0,1), and a number in [0,1], the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit sphere shell with the inner raidus alpha.
