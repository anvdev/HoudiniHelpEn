"""Resolves an operator path string and return its op_id."""

:usage: `int opid(string op_path)`
:usage: `int opid( int op_id )`

    Resolves an operator path and returns its corresponding operator id.
Return -1 on failure. The form that takes an operator id as an input returns 1
if it is a valid operator id, otherwise it returns 0. This can be used to test
if an operator id is valid.

    The operator id can change when reloading the scene.
