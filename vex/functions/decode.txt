"""Decodes a variable or geometry attribute name that was previously encoded."""

:usage: `string decode(string str)`

Houdini geometry attributes and group names are only allowed to contain
letters, numbers, and underscores, and must not begin with a number. Arbitrary
strings can be passed through the `encode` function to generate a string that
obeys these restriction. This function takes one of these encoded strings, and
returns the original string. A string that has not been encoded will be
returned unmodified.
