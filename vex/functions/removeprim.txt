"""Removes a primitive from the geometry."""

:usage: `int removeprim(int geohandle, int prim_number, int andpoints)`

[Include:_common#geohandle_arg]

:arg:prim_number:
	The index of the primitive to remove. If this is `-1`, the function does nothing.

:arg:andpoints:
	If this is `1`, the function will also delete any points associated with the primitive that are not associated with any other primitives.

NOTE:
    If some primitives are being removed with `andpoints` set to `0` and some are being removed with `andpoints` set to `1`, all of the primitives with `andpoints` set to `0` will be deleted before all of the primitives with `andpoints` set to `1`.
