"""Returns the number of half-edges equivalent to a given half-edge."""

:usage: `int hedge_equivcount(<geometry>, int hedge)`

NOTE:
    Equivalent half-edges may be oppositely oriented, i.e. the source of one can be the destination of the other and vice versa.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge:
    Input half-edge.

:returns:
    The number of half-edges that have the same endpoint as `hedge` (including `hedge`), or `-1` if the half-edge is not valid.
