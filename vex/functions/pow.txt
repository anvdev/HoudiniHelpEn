"""Raises the first argument to the power of the second argument."""

:usage: `float pow(float n, float exponent)`
:usage: `<vector> pow(<vector> v, float exponent)`

    Raises `n` to the power of `exponent`. For vectors, this is done per-component.

    When `n` is less than zero, the exponent will be rounded to the closest integer.
