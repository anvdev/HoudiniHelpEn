"""Indicates whether the shader is being evaluated while doing UV rendering (e.g. texture unwrapping)"""

:usage: `int isuvrendering()`

Returns 1 if the shader is being called while evaluating uv rendering (texture unwrapping), and 0 for normal rendering.

Use this function to evaluate shaders differently when baking illumination.
