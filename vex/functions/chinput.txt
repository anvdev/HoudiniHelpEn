"""Returns the value of a channel at the specified sample."""

:usage: `<type> chinput(int channel_index, int|float sample)`
:usage: `<type> chinput(int opinput, int channel_index, int|float sample)`

    Read a sample from the channel at the given index.
    The version without `opinput` assumes the first input (0).

:usage: `<type> chinput(string channel_name, int|float sample)`
:usage: `<type> chinput(int opinput, string channel_name, int|float sample)`

    Read a sample from the channel with the given name.
    The version without `opinput` assumes the first input (0).

:usage: `int chinput(int channel_index, int|float sample, vector &t, vector &r, vector &s)`
:usage: `int chinput(int opinput, int channel_index, int|float sample, vector &t, vector &r, vector &s)`

    Read samples from the 9 channels starting at the given index.
    The samples are returned in the 3 vector output arguments.
    Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
    The version without `opinput` assumes the first input (0).

:usage: `int chinput(string channel_name, int|float sample, vector &t, vector &r, vector &s)`
:usage: `int chinput(int opinput, string channel_name, int|float sample, vector &t, vector &r, vector &s)`

    Read samples from the 9 channels starting at the given channel name.
    The samples are returned in the 3 vector output arguments.
    Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
    The version without `opinput` assumes the first input (0).

[Include:_common#opinput_arg]

:arg:sample:
    If this is fractional, the value is linearly interpolated from the
    two nearest points.

:returns:
    The value of a channel at the specified sample in an input.
