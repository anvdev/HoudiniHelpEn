"""Returns 1 if the point specified by the point number is in the group specified by the string."""

:usage: `int inpointgroup(<geometry>, string groupname, int pointnum)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:returns:
    `1` if the group exists and the point is in the group, or `0` otherwise.

This can use ad-hoc groups, like `0-3` or `@Cd.x>0.5`.  It matches the SOP
group naming convention, in particular that an empty string means all points.
