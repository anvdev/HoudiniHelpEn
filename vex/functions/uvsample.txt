"""Interpolates the value of an attribute at certain UV coordinates using a UV attribute."""

This function specifies the position using UVs from a UV attribute. To use _intrinsic primitive UVs_, use [Vex:primuv] instead.

:arg:primgroup:
    The name of a primitive group or a pattern to generate a primitive
    group.  Uses the same semantics as a SOP group, so empty strings
    will match all primitives.  Attribute groups like `@Cd.x>0` can
    also be used, but note that the `@` may need to be escaped with
    a backslash in a [Snippet VOP|Node:vop/snippet].

:arg:attr_name:
    The name of a point or vertex attribute to sample. For primitive attributes, the value is taken from the primitive under the given UVs. *For point and vertex attributes, the value will at the given UV coordinates will be interpolated from the surrounding points/vertices*. The values are taken from the "lowest" level at which an attribute with this name exists.

:arg:uv_attr_name:
    The name of a point or vertex attribute containing UVs. The default UVs created by Houdini are in an attribute named `uv`. The named attribute can be 2D (UV) or 3D (UVW) in any vector type.

:arg:uvw:
    The position in UV(W) space at which to sample the attribute.
