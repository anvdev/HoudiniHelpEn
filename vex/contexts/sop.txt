attributes."""

WARNING:
    This context is obsolete and no longer used in Houdini.
    VEX that manipulates geometry now executes in the more generic CVEX context.


@globals

::P:
    #type: vector
    
    Position of the current point.

::Pw:
    #type: float
    
    Point weight.

::v:
    #type: vector
    
    Velocity of the current point.

::accel:
    #type: vector
    
    Acceleration of the current point.

::age:
    #type: float
    
    Age of the current point (how many seconds a particle has been alive).

::life:
    #type: float
    
    Expected lifetime (in seconds) of the current point.

::pstate:
    #type: int
    
    State of the current particle. This is an integer bit field with the
    following flags:

    `0x01` |
        Is a "primary" particle (not birthed from an existing
        particle).
    `0x02` |
        Will die before the next frame.
    `0x04` |
        Stopped.
    `0x08` |
        Has collided.
    `0x10` |
        Stuck to static or moving geometry.
    `0x20` |
        Is associated with a rigid body dynamic simulation.
    `0x40` |
        Active.
    `0x80` |
        Motion is overridden by a CHOP.

::id:
    #type: int
    
    ID attribute.

::ptnum:
    #type: int
    #mode: r
    
    Point number of the point being processed.

::Cd:
    #type: vector
    
    Color (RGB) of the current point.

::N:
    #type: vector
    
    Point normal.

::Npt:
    #type: int
    #mode: r

    Total number of points geometry.

::Time:
    #type: float
    #mode: r
    
    Current time (in seconds).

::Frame:
    #type: float
    #mode: r
    
    Current frame. This may not be an integer value.

::TimeInc:
    #type: float
    #mode: r
    
    Time increment between frames (SOP context).
