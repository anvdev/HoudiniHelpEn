#subtopics_title: Contexts

"""Guide to the different contexts in which you can write VEX
programs."""

Unlike C or C++, VEX has different "contexts" for which you write programs. These contexts define how the function is to be used.

For example, one context is the "surface" context. Functions written in this context are used to calculate the color(s) of a surface during rendering. The global variables and functions provided for each context are slightly different.
