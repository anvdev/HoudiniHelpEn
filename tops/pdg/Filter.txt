"""A set of work items"""

A set of work item IDs, used when filtering static items during a cook.


@methods

::`__init__(self, strict=False)`:
    #cppname: PDG_Filter::PDG_Filter

    Constructs a new filter, which defaults to including all work items. When
    `strict` is set, the filter requires exact matches. When not set, dependencies
    from work items in the filter are implicitly included.

::`appendToSet(self, id)`:
    #cppname: PDG_Filter::appendToSet

    Appends the work item ID to the set.

::`setNone(self)`:
    #cppname: PDG_Filter::setNone

    Clears the filter.
