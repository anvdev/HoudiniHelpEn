"""The enumeration of batch activation conditions"""

This enum contains the possible values for when a [Py:pdg.BatchWorkItem] begins
cooking. By default, batches begin when all dependencies for all subitems are
ready, however it is possible to generate a batch that cooks when its first
subitem or any subitem is ready.


@values

:: All
    The batch will begin cooking when all subitems have their dependencies satisfied

:: Any
    The batch will begin cooking when any of the subitems have their dependencies satisfied

:: First
    The batch will begin cooking when the first subitem has its dependencies satisfied.
