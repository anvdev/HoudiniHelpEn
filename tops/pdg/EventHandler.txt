= pdg.EventHandler =
#type: pyclass
#group: events

"""Represents a handler function added to a node or graph."""

You get this opaque object back when you add a custom event handler using
[Py:pdg.Node#addEventHandler()] or [Py:pdg.GraphContext#addEventHandler()].
If you want to remove the handler later, you must pass this object to
[Py:pdg.Node#removeEventHandler()] or [Py:pdg.GraphContext#removeEventHandler()].
