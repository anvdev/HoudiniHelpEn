"""The enumeration of possible cook modes"""

This enum contains the possible cook types that can be passed to the `pdg.GraphContext._cook(..)`
method, using a [Py:pdg.CookOptions] object.


@values

:: Full
    Performs a full cook of all nodes in the graph

:: GenerateFull
    Generates static items for all nodes in the graph

:: GenerateNode
    Generates the graph down to a particular node. Upstream dynamic nodes will
    be cooked if needed.

:: Node
    Cooks the graph for a particular node. Upstream nodes will only be cooked
    if necessary.

:: StaticDepsFull
    Does a static cook of the whole graph. This consists of doing a `GenerateFull`,
    and then calling the `onScheduleStatic` implementation of the user's custom
    scheduler.

    Note that this is a fairly obscure cook mode, and will not work out of the box
    with stock schedulers.

:: StaticDepsNode
    The same as `StaticDepsFull`, but for a particular node.
