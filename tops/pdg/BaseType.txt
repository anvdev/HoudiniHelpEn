"""Base class for custom Node, Work Item and Scheduler types."""

Custom graph nodes, work items, or schedulers have a `type` object
associated with them. This object holds information about the custom type
such as a human-readable label and the implementation language.
This is the base class for these type objects.


@methods

::`instanceCount` : `int`:
    #cppname: PDG_BaseType::instanceCount

    The number of instances of the type that have been created, potentially
    across multiple PDG graphs.

::`language` : [Py:pdg.language]:
    #cppname: PDG_BaseType::language

    The language that the type object was written with, i.e. C++ or Python.

::`typeLabel` : `str`:
    #cppname: PDG_BaseType::typeLabel

    The human-readable label associated with the type. Does not necessarily
    have to be unique.

::`typeName` : `str`:
    #cppname: PDG_BaseType::typeName

    The unique, internal name for the type. Always unique.
