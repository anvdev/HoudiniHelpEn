"""Represents a node's dependence on the existence of an external file."""

The `key` property contains the file path.  The given file will be copied to the
PDG working directory before the first work item from the node is scheduled to
execute.

This can be used to ensure that supporting files like digital assets and custom scripts are available for the work item job.

The specified paths can be absolute or relative to HOUDINI_PATH.
