@parameters
    Save to Disk:
        Saves channels to disk.
    Frame Range:
        Allows specification of a range of frames to render.

        NOTE:
            This should typically be set to `Render Current Frame`. It only
            makes sense to specify a frame range in the rare case that your
            CHOP node is time dependent. The `Output File`'s frame range will
            always match that of the specified CHOP.
    Start/End/Inc:
        Specifies the first and last frames and the increment. Note that
        when rendering a sequence of files with a fraction Inc, `$N` is
        the number of the frame rendered, $F is the nearest integer
        frame number, `$FF` is the floating point frame number.
    CHOP Path:
        Selects the CHOP node to render.
    Output File:
        Selects where the output is sent.

    [Include:standard#mkpath]

    Initialize Simulation OPs:
        Forces all simulation OPs to be reset. This includes DOP
        Networks, POP SOPs, and other OPs that cache their results.
    Pre-Render Script:
        Execute this script before any rendering.
    Pre-Frame Script:
        Execute this script before each frame
    Post-Frame Script:
        Execute this script after each frame
    Post-Render Script:
        Execute this script after all rendering
@locals
    N:
        Frame being rendered.
    NRENDER:
        Total number of frames being rendered.
