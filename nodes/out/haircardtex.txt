= Hair Card Texture =

"""Renders hair textures for use on hair cards."""

Generates textures to be used on geometry generated by
[Hair Card Generate|Node:obj/haircardgen] object. Together, the exported
geometry and textures can be used to render realistic hair cards in game
engines.

@parameters

== Objects ==

Camera:
    #id: camera

    The camera to render with. The camera should typically frame the hair objects
    and Projection should be set to Orthogonal.

Hair Objects:
    #id: hairobjects

    The hair objects to render.

Force Objects:
    #id: forceobjects

    Forces objects to render even when they are hidden.

== Rendering ==

Resolution:
    #id: res

    The texture resolution to output.

Pixel Samples:
    #id: vm_samples

    The number of rays to cast per pixel. Higher values produce a higher
    quality image with less noise.

== Output ==

Save Location:
    #id: vm_picture

    The directory to render to.

Name Prefix:
    #id: nameprefix

    The name of the texture set.

Separator:
    #id: namesep

    The separate between the name prefix and the image plane suffix.

File Type:
    #id: nameext

    The image file type to output.

NOTE:
    For example, the diffuse texture would be named `hairtexture_diff.tga` when
    __Name Prefix__ is set to `hairtexture`, __Separator__ is set to `_`, the
    __Diffuse__ name is set to `diff` and the __File Type__ to `tga`.

== Image Planes ==

Diffuse:
    #id: diffusename

    The suffix of the diffuse texture.

Alpha:
    #id: alphaname

    The suffix of the alpha texture.

ID:
    #id: idname

    The name of the id texture.

Tip:
    #id: tipname

    The name of the tip texture.

Depth:
    #id: depthname

    The name of the depth texture.

UV Bounds:
    #id: uvboundsname

    The name of the UV bounds texture.

    This texture can be used by the Hair Card Generate Object or SOP to
    generate matching UV coordinates on the card geometry.
