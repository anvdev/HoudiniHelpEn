"""This output operator is used to write agent definition files."""

This output operator is used to write files that define an agent. The created
files can then be loaded in by the [Node:sop/agent] geometry node to create
agent primitives for crowds.

NOTE:
    Agent primitives currently only support deforming point normals and not
    vertex normals. When the deforming geometry is written out, vertex normals
    will be automatically promoted to point normals as a result.

@parameters

[Include:standard#render_buttons_only/]

Valid Frame Range:
    What frames to render.

    Render Current Frame:
        Allow the baking any and all frames.
        
    Render Frame Range:
        Only bake the frames in the range set below, but allow the baking other
        frames if they are referenced by in-range frames.
        
    Render Frame Range Only (Strict):
        Only bake the frames in the range set below, and don't allow baking of
        other frames, even if they are referenced by in-range frames.

Start/End/Inc:
    The range of frames for the clip (start frame, end frame, and
    increment), inclusive.
    
    All values may be decimal (for example, start on frame 1.5).. 

Render with Take:
    Uses the settings in a particular take while rendering. Choose
    __Current__ to use the current take when rendering.

Source:
    Specifies the source of the agent definition that will be written to disk.

    Character Rig:
        Generate an agent definition from a character rig in the scene.

    Agent Primitive:
        Use the agent definition from an existing agent primitive.

    FBX:
	Generate an agent definition from an FBX file containing a character.

* [Include:/nodes/sop/agent#objsubnet]

SOP Path:
    Specifies a SOP network that contains an agent primitive.

Agent Name:
    #id: agentname
    Name of the agent. The parameter is provided for convenience
    so that it can be referenced via the `$AGENT` local variable in other
    parameter values.

Cache Directory:
    #id: cachedir
    Parent directory of agent definition files. This parameter is
    provided for convenience so that its value can be referenced via the
    `$CACHEDIR` local variable in the other filename parameters.

Rig:
    #id: rig
    Filename for the agent rig.
    The [rig file|/crowds/agents#rig] is a JSON file describing the transform hierarchy of the agent.

Agent Layers:
    #id: layers
    Filename pattern for [agent layer files|/crowds/agents#layer].
    The `${LAYER}` local variable can be used to the include the name of the layer in the filename.

Shape Library:
    #id: shapelib
    Filename for the [agent shape library|/crowds/agents#shapelib].

Clips:
    #id: clips
    Filename pattern for [agent clip files|/crowds/agents#clip].
    The `${CLIP}` local variable can be used to the include the name of the clip in the filename.

Transform Groups:
    #id: transformgroups
    Filename pattern for [agent transform group files|/crowds/agents#xformgroups].
    The `${TRANSFORM_GROUP}` local variable can be used to include the name of the transform group in the filename.

* [Include:standard#soho_mkpath]

Pre-Render Script:
    Execute this script before any baking.
Post-Render Script:
    Execute this script after all baking

@locals

AGENT:
    The name of agent. The value either comes from the `agentname` string
    attribute on the input points when __Allow Attributes to Override__ is
    enabled, or from the value of the __Agent Name__ parameter.

CACHEDIR:
    A local variable provided for convenience so that the value of the __Cache
    Directory__ parameter can be easily referenced.

LAYER:
    Contains the name of the current layer when evaluating the __Agent Layers__ parameter.

CLIP:
    Contains the name of the current clip when evaluating the __Clips__ parameter.

TRANSFORM_GROUP:
    Contains the name of the current transform group when evaluating the __Transform Groups__ filename parameter.

FBX_TAKE_NAME:
    Contains the name of the current take in the FBX file when evaluating the __Clip Name__ parameter and __Source__ is __FBX__.

FBX_TAKE_INDEX:
    Contains the index of the current take in the FBX file when evaluating the __Clip Name__ parameter and __Source__ is __FBX__.
