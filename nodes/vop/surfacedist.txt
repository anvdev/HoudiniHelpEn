= Surface Distance =

"""Finds the shortest distance between a point and a source point group."""

This operator finds the shortest distance to the closest point in the given
point group, and returns which point in the group it was closest to as well.

@parameters

Geometry File:
    Disk file to read for the geometry. Can be `op:/obj/object/soppath` to read
    live SOP geometry.

Group:
    The point group to measure the distance from. This can be any point
    pattern, including @ adhoc points.

    Empty patterns will match all points, as in SOPs.

Position Channel:
    The name of the vector attribute to use to measure distance between
    connected points. Using `P` will give the world distance along the surface,
    but another attribute can be used to measure along a different metric.

Point:
    The point to measure the distance for.

Soft Radius:
    The maximum distance to measure the surface distance.  This can speed
    things up by allowing the search to quit early if the point is not within
    the radius. Points outside the radius will return a value of `-1` for both
    the distance and the closest point in group.

Distance Metric:
    The method to use to measure distance. Accepted values are `edge` and
    `surface`. Edge distance is measured along the edges of the model, while
    surface distance is measured along edges and across surfaces.

Distance:
    Distance to the closest point in the group.

    `-1` if no closest point was found.

Closest Point In Group:
    Index of the closest point in the group.

    `-1` if no closest point was found.
