= CVEX Shader Builder =

"""A node that implements a CVEX shader using its children VOPs."""

== Overview ==

The CVEX Shader Builder constructs CVEX shader code based on the VOP network inside. The children's inputs and output represent local variables and the children themselves provide code snippets that operate on these local variables. The Shader Builder puts together these code snippets into a coherent and valid shader function.
