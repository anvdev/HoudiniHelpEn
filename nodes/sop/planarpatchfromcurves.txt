= Planar Patch from Curves =

"""Fills in a 2d curve network with triangles."""

Planar Patch from Curves takes a network of 2d curves and fills it with a uniform tesselation of triangles.

The curves should provide a closed outline, but internal curves can be provided to ensure triangles edges follow interior seams.

@parameters

Build Plane:
    #id: plane
    
    The curves are projected onto this plane for computing the inside/outside
    and crossing decisions.
    
Reverse Curves:
    #id: doreverse
    
    Reverse the sense of the incoming curves.  This affects the point order
    in the generated seam groups.
    
Resample Curves:
    #id: doresample
    
    Enable the resampling of the curves.  They will be resampled so they
    have an edge spacing matching the interior edge length.
    
Smoothing:
    #id: smoothresample

    Controls how the curves are resampled.
    
    Straight Edges:
	New points are placed along the incoming edges, keeping the edges
	straight.  Note that since the original vertices may not be used,
	corners may not be interpolated.
        
    Subdivision Curves:
	Treat the curves as the hull of a subdivision curve network.  The
	start and end will interpolate, but the interior will smoothly
	follow the curve defined by the convex hull.
        
    Interpolating Curves:
	Like subdivision curves, but using the incoming curves as
	interpolating points rather than a hull.
    
Interior Edge Length:
    #id: edgelen
    
    The approximate size of the triangles to generate internally.
    
== Groups ==

Patch Name:
    #id: patchname
    
    Output a `patch` attribute on the primitives with this value.  Useful
    for when merging multiple patches together.
    
Seam Groups:
    #id: seamgroup

    Prefix for generated seam groups.  Each curve's generated points
    will be added to an ordered group of this name followed by the curve
    number.
    
    
Interior Points:
    #id: interiorgroup
    
    Create a point group to contain all the generated interior points.
    
Remove Interior Points from Groups:
    #id: removeinteriorgroups
    
    Ensure the interior points do not inherit any of the incoming
    point group memberships.
