"""Adjusts the head of an agent to look at a specific object or position."""

This node is used to modify the transform of the head bone of an agent to orient
it towards an object or position.

=== Attributes ===

This node requires the `agentrig_head` and `agentrig_restclip` attributes to be present on the input geometry.
These attributes can be created by the [Agent Prep SOP|Node:sop/agentprep#attributes].

@parameters

== Look At ==

    Group:
            The group of agents to modify.

    Eye Offset:
            An offset to add to the head bone's position.

    Horizontal Limit Angle:
            The maximum angle (in degrees) that the head can rotate horizontally.

    Vertical Limit Angle:
            The maximum angle (in degrees) that the head can rotate vertically.

    Limit Head Turn Per Frame:
        #id: limitheadturn
        If enabled, limits how far the agent's head can rotate in a single frame. This causes the agent's head to gradually turn towards the target. If disabled, the agent's head will always look directly at the target position.

    Adjust Immediately on Initial Frame:
        #id: immediateadjust
        Specifies that the head should be adjusted immediately on the initial frame (if necessary), instead of being limited by the maximum turn rate.

    Head Turn Angle:
        #id: headturnangle
        The maximum angle (in degrees) that the agent's head can rotate by in a single frame if __Limit Head Turn Per Frame__ is enabled.

    Look Ats:
            The objects or positions for the agents to look at. Each agent will choose the closest target that is within its field of view, and a new target will only be selected when the current target is no longer visible.
