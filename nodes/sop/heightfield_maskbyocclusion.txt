"""Creates a mask where the input terrain is hollow/depressed, for example riverbeds and valleys."""

The node calculates measures occlusion as "how much of a sphere centered on the point is visible from the given point." It sends rays from each point in different directions and measures how many hit terrain before reaching their maximum distance.

[Include:_heightfield_common#combine]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#blend]

Minimum Occlusion: Minimum occlusion to mask.
    #id: minexposure
    
    Scales the output mask. Areas with occlusion less than or equal to this value will have mask 0.0.

Maximum Occlusion:  Maximum occlusion to mask.
    #id: maxexposure
    
    Scales the output mask. Areas with occlusion greater than or equal to this value with have mask 1.0.

Occlusion Ramp:
    #id: ramp

    A ramp mapping the sunlight exposure at a given point (ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values being more exposed) to the mask value at that point.


Sample from Hemisphere: Sample from Hemisphere.
    #id: dohemisphere
    
    Instead of measuring the visibility of a sphere centered on each point, measure the visibility of a hemisphere in the Y direction.


=== Quality ===

View Distance:
    #id: viewdistance
    
    How far to send rays to determine if a point can see the sky. Longer distances give more accurate measurements, but can be slower. A value of 0 corresponds to a view distance of infinity.
    
Step Scale:
    #id: stepscale
    
    How finely to step along the rays to determine if a point can see the sky. Larger values are faster but might miss thin features.
    
Number of Searches:
    #id: numsearches
    
    How many rays to send to determine if a point can see the sky. Larger numbers give more accurate measurements, but can be slower.
