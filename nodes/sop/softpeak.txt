= Soft Peak =

"""Moves the selected point along its normal, with smooth rolloff to
surrounding points."""

Unlike the [Peak node|Node:sop/peak],
Soft Peak takes into account a rolloff function and a
radius of influence. The points within radius distance to the selected
point or group will be displaced by an amount proportional to the distance,
similar to the [Soft Transform node|Node:sop/softxform]


@parameters
Group:
    Subset of points to translate.
Distance:
    #channels: /dist

    Distance along normal by which to translate.
Distance Metric:
    #id: distmetric

    Method for measuring which points are within the soft radius.

    Edge:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
        edges.
    Surface:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path
        along the surface.
    Radius:
        The 3D distance to the closest point in the group.
    Radius with Connectivity (deprecated):
        The 3D distance to the closest point in the group, as long as there
        is a connected path contained entirely within the __Soft Radius__.
    Attribute:
        __Lead Point Attribute__ is used to determine which normal each
        point should follow, and __Distance Attribute__ determines how
        much each point is translated. Only points in the input group will
        be translated, even if other points have valid values in the
        attribute.
Apply Rolloff:
    #id: applyrolloff

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__, apply a rolloff to the distance
    output by treating the __Distance Attribute__ as raw distances. A value
    of zero will be fully transformed, while higher values will be
    transformed less. Only points whose values are less than or equal to
    __Soft Radius__ will be affected. If this is toggled off, the __Distance
    Attribute__ value is treated as if it has already been rolled off, and
    the transform is multiplied by the value. A value of one will be fully
    transformed while smaller values will be transformed less.
Distance Attribute:
    #id: distattr

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__, this specifies the point attribute
    containing the values that modify the amount each point in the group is
    transformed by. If __Apply Rolloff__ is true the values are treated as
    raw distances and will be rolled off to between zero and one, otherwise
    the transform amount is multiplied by the value.
Soft Radius:
    #channels: /radius

    Area of influence.
Soft type:
    #id: type

    The type of rolloff for soft modifications. This affects how
    much influence your direct edits have on other points/faces
    with the soft radius, based on their distance.

    Linear:
        Linear falloff: the amount of influence decreases
        linearly with distance.
    Quadratic:
        Slow falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
        more than with Cubic.
    Cubic:
        Quick falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
        less than with Quadratic.
    Metaball:
        Calculate falloff according with the metaball density
        function you specify in the __Kernal function__
        parameter.
Tangent Angles:
    #channels: /tandeg

    Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first value
    applies to the tangent farthest from the source point, the
    second applies to the tangent closest to the source point.
Kernel Function:
    [Metaball
    kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]  to use
    when rolloff Type is "Meta-ball".
Lead Point Attribute:
    #id: leadptattr

    If __Distance Metric__ is __Attribute__ and __Translate Along Lead Normal__
    is true, this specifies the point attribute containing the point index
    of the whose normal should be translated along. A value of -1 will cause
    the point to be translated along its own normal.
Translate Along Lead Normal:
    Translate points within the radius along the normal of the
    point in Group closest to them. Otherwise translate along their
    respective normals, giving a mushrooming effect.
Recompute Point Normals:
    Recomputes point normals if they exist.
Visualize Falloff:
    When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
    attribute.

    Never:
        Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
    Always:
        Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
    When Viewport Tool Is Active:
        Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
        when the viewport tool for this node is active.
        
@locals
    NPT:
        The number of points.
    NPR:
        The number of primitives.
