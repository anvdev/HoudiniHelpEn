= TOP SOP =

"""Sends input geometry to a TOP subnet and retrieves the output geometry."""

This network processes input geometry using TOP nodes and passes any output
geometry on the next SOP node. If the TOP network produces multiple output
work items, the geometry is merged into a single detail with groups named after
the original work items.

Unlike a regular TOP network, this node will block the UI when cooking as part
of a chain of SOP nodes.

@parameters

Attributes:
    #id: attribute

    Point attribute names that will be loaded into work item attributes.

Dirty on Cook:
    #id: dirtyoncook

    When this toggle is enabled, the TOP network always be dirtied before it
    gets evaluated.

Task Graph File:
    #id: taskgraphfile

    The path to the task graph checkpoint file.

Load From Disk:
    #id: loadfromdisk

    When this toggle is enabled, the task graph checkpoint file will be loaded
    from disk instead of recooking the TOP network. If there is no task graph
    file for the current frame, then the network will be recooked and a
    checkpoint file will be written to disk.

Force Recook:
    #id: forcerecook

    Forces a recook of the TOP network.

Default TOP Scheduler:
    #id: topscheduler

    The default scheduler used by all nodes that don't have a per-node override.
