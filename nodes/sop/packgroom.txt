= Groom Pack =

"""Packs the components of a groom into a set of named Packed Primitives for the purpose of writing it to disk."""

The package can contain both the static and animated guide curves and skin.

Use the [Groom Unpack SOP|Node:sop/unpackgroom] to unpack the components from the package.

Groom objects like a [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform], [Guide Sim|Node:obj/guidesim], and [Guide Sim|Node:obj/hairgen] can read a groom package from file and unpack it for further processing or hair
generation and rendering.
