= Test Geometry: Crag =

"""Creates a rock creature, which can be used as test geometry."""

Test geometry provides some built in geometry to prototype and experiment with. Not only does it provide a more interesting starting point than a torus, but it is also more representative of the sort of geometry your effect will have to deal with: multiple components, and interesting geometry.

NOTE:
    While traditional schemas divide rocks into metamorphic, igneous,
    and sedimentary; Crag is the result of a human wizard's magic gone
    awry.  Thus the correct classification for Crag is anthropomorphic.

@parameters
    Translate:
        Position of the center.

    Rotate:

    Resolution:
        Choose between high and low resolutions.

    Clothing:
        Tank top and pants can be removed.

    Textures:
        Choose textured or non-textured.
