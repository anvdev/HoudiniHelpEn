"""Generates an edge group representing suggested seams for flattening a polygon model in UV space."""

@parameters

Group:
    When this is blank, the node applies to all geometry in the input. You can enter the name of a primitive group, or specify primitives using [group syntax|/model/groups#manual] to operate on only a subset of primitives.


== Enforce cuts ==

Include edges:
    Always include edges in this group as seams.

Island attribute:
    The name of an integer primitive attribute. If this is not blank, polygons with the same value for this attribute are treated as UV islands, and the edges across which the value is different are treated as seams.


== Avoid cuts ==

Exclude edges:
    The node will not turn edges in this group into seams.

Avoid attribute:
    The name of a float point attribute. If this is not blank, the node will attempt to avoid cutting points with a value greater than 0, with higher values making the node try harder to avoid the point.

Weight:
    A scaling factor for the values in the __Avoid attribute__. 


== Grain islands ==

UV Autoseam works by starting from a set of small "grain" seed islands and merging them up to get the larger islands.

Splitting:
    Curvature Based:
        Use the local properties of the mesh (such as curvature) to produce initial grain islands.

    Existing Islands:
        Use existing UV islands in the input as the starting point.

Grain tolerance:
    When __Splitting__ is "Curvature based", controls how sensitive grains are to changes in normal direction across surfaces. A value of zero is very sensitive and produces tiny grains. Larger values up to 1 are less sensitive and produce larger grains.

Merge threshold:
    Controls how often smaller grains merge to become larger islands. `0` never merges (giving the initial grains as output), `1` merges _all_ connected grains together (giving no seams in the output). You can tweak this control, centering around `0.5`, to get more or fewer seams.

UV Attribute:
    When __Splitting__ is "Existing islands", the UV attribute from which to get the islands. This is usually `uv`.

Connectivity Tolerance:
    When __Splitting__ is "Existing islands", the maximum difference between attribute values across the end points of an edge that determine an existing seam.


== Output groups and attributes ==

Seams Group Name:
    Outputs the computed seams in an edge group with this name.

Island Attribute:
    Adds an attribute to the polygons containing the number of the island the polygon was in.
