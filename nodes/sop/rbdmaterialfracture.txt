"""Fractures the input geometry based on a material type."""


== Overview ==

This node allows you to accurately fracture geometry based on a specific type of material. Currently concrete, glass panels, and wood are supported.

It accepts four inputs: geometry, constraint geometry, proxy geometry, and an optional input for extra points to control the fracturing process. It will fracture the incoming geometry using different fracturing method depending on the material specified in the __Material Type__ parameter. If an input constraint geometry is specified, it will update the constraints for the fractured pieces.

* [Concrete|#concrete]
* [Glass|#glass]
* [Wood|#wood]

See [fracturing objects for simulation|/dyno/fracturing] for a guide to fracturing workflows and tools in Houdini.


== Using different displays ==

The __Guide Geometry__ parameter on the [RBD Material Fracture|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] node will allow you to switch between different displays. All materials have __Fractured Geometry__, which will display the group being fractured.

[Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_glass_none.png]
[Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_wood_none.png]

They also all have __Constraint Network__, which will display the internal constraint network of all fractured pieces.

[Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_wood_constraintnetwork.png]

There are two concrete-specific displays: __Primary Volume__ and __Edge Detail__. These views allow you to display the volume distribution for each primary fracture level used for scattering and display the boolean cutting planes used to generate the edge detail.

There are also two glass-specific displays: __Concentric Noise__ and __Edge Detail__. These views allow you to display the noise used for determining the discontinuity for concentric cracks and display the magnitude distribution of the edge noise.

The three wood-specific displays allow you to display the cutting planes for grains, cuts, and splinters.

== Working with concrete ==

* The __Fracture Level__ will control how many cuts your object will have. Increasing this number will add more fractures to the existing fractured pieces, breaking each chunk into smaller pieces.

    [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_concrete1.png] [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_concrete2.png]
    
* Turning on __Edge Detail__ will add more noise to the cuts.

    [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_concrete1.png] [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_concrete3.png]
    
* Use the [RBD Paint|Node:sop/rbdpaint] node to interactively paint weaker areas on the geometry in the viewport before the [RBD Material Fracture|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] node. This will paint a `density` attribute in the areas you want more fracturing to occur. 

    NOTE:
        Choose __Scatter From Attribute__ on the [RBD Material Fracture|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] node and specify `density` as the __Attribute Name__.

== Working with glass ==

NOTE:
    This is meant to be used for glass panels (flat objects). Curved glass isn't currently supported.
    
* __Fracture per Piece__ is extremely useful when working with different panes of glass. It allows you to loop through each piece in the input geometry and fracture them individually.

    [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_glass_panels.png]

* The parameters on the __Cracks__ tab are useful for determining how many cracks you want the glass to have.

* __ Enable Chipping__ on the __Chipping__ tab will give your simulation more details, as it will chip the corners of the broken glass as it breaks apart.


== Working with wood ==

* By default, the fracture direction of wood is determined by its longest point.

    [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_wood_direction.png]

* To determine the amount of fracturing, you can edit the __Cut Spacing__ parameters to give the wood more or less cuts.

    [Image:/images/dynamics/rbdmaterialfracture_wood_cut.png]

* Use the controls on the __Cluster__ tab to stick fractured pieces together into larger chunks that won't break apart. This will give your simulations more variation in shapes and sizes.
