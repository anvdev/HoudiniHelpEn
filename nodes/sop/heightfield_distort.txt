"""Advects the input volume through a noise pattern to break up hard edges and add variety."""

Whereas [Heightfield Noise|Node:sop/heightfield_noise] changes the height values up and down, this node moves the existing values around by advecting them through a noise field, similar to how a Photoshop filter might distort an image by swirling the existing pixels.


@parameters

Distort Layers:
    #id: layer
    
    A pattern specifying which layers to operate on, usually `height` or `*`.

[Include:_heightfield_common#masklayer]
    
Curl Noise:
    #id: curl
    
    Create distortion using curl noise. This can create interesting swirled features at large amplitudes. If this is off, the node uses anti-aliased noise instead.

Amplitude:
    #id: amp
    
    Amount of distortion to do. Larger values move, stretch, and swirl the existing features more. With larger amplitude values you should consider increasing the __Substeps__. Otherwise the entire large-scale change is applied at once, which can create a mess.
    
Element Size:
    #id: element_size
    
    Distance between peaks of lowest frequency noise.

Element Scale:
    #id: element_scale
    
    Anisotropic scaling of noise in the three principle axis. 

Offset:
    #id: offset
    
    World space offset for the noise function.

Roughness:
    #id: rough
    
    Fractal roughness.
    
Max Octaves:
    #id: maxoctave
    
    The number of iterations of distortion to add to the output of the basic noise. The more iterations you add, the more "detailed" the output. 
    
Substeps:
    #id: steps
    
    Divides the total desired amplitude by this amount and incrementally applies it in steps. This allows finer details and less drastic changes, but is slower. You will usually want to increase substeps as you increase __Amplitude__ to prevent large scale changes from creating a mess.
