"""Combines fractured pieces or constraints into larger clusters."""

This SOP combines fractured pieces into larger clusters, either by adjusting the `name` attribute or by grouping the intracluster and intercluster constraints.
The optional incoming `cluster` attribute on the constraint geometry points can be further refined with the __Add Cluster Noise__ and __Random Detach__ parameters.

@parameters

Cluster Type:
    #id: clustertype
    Specifies how to apply the clustering to the input geometry.

    Combine Pieces:
        Adjusts the `name` primitive attribute to combine pieces into clusters.
        This will result in fewer objects in the simulation.
        The constraint geometry is also updated to reflect the new pieces.

    Group Constraints:
        The input geometry is not modified, but primitive groups are added to the constraint geometry to identify constraints between clusters, internal constraints in a cluster, etc.
        This can be used with the [RBD Constraint Properties SOP|Node:sop/rbdconstraintproperties] to, for example, create stronger constraints between pieces in the same cluster.
        With this approach, the clustered chunks may be broken apart during the simulation by breaking the constraints within a cluster.

Cluster Name Prefix:
    The prefix applied to the name of each clustered piece.

Intracluster Group:
    The name of the group containing constraints between pieces in the same cluster.

Cluster to Cluster Group:
    The name of the group containing constraints between pieces in different clusters.

Cluster to Piece Group:
    The name of the group containing constraints between a piece that is in a cluster and a non-clustered piece.

Piece to Piece Group:
    The name of the group containing constraints between non-clustered pieces.

Cluster Attribute:
    The name of an integer point attribute on the input constraint geometry.

Cluster Noise:
    Adds cellular noise to the input points of the constraint geometry.
    The default behavior is to preserve the existing values of the __Cluster Attribute__ if it exists on the input constraint geometry.

Offset:
    #id: offset
    The offset of the cellular noise added to the input points.

Jitter:
    #id: jitter
    The jitter of the cellular noise added to the input points.

Size:
    #id: size
    The size of the cells for the noise added to the input points.
    This roughly corresponds to the size of the clusters.

Random Detachment:
    #id: randomdetach
    Randomly detach pieces from clusters.

Detach Seed:
    #id: detachseed
    The random seed used for detachment.

Detach Ratio:
    #id: detachratio
    The probability that a particular piece will be detached.
