"""Writes agent definition files to disk."""

This SOP combines an Agent ROP and Agent SOP to provide a simple way to write out an agent primitive's definition to disk.
This can be useful at the end of a SOP chain that initializes an agent (for example, using the [Agent Clip SOP|Node:/sop/agentclip] and [Agent Layer SOP|Node:/sop/agentlayer]).

The [Caches|/crowds/caches] help page provides more information on when it may be advantageous to store the agent definition as separate files on disk.
