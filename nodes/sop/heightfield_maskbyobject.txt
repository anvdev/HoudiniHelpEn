"""Creates a mask based some other geometry."""

You can create the mask by projecting surface geometry onto the height field, or by intersecting the height field with a fog or SDF volume.

Connect a height field to the first input, and the geometry to the second input.

TIP:
    This node projects the outline of geometry into a mask field as 2D. To project the geometry into a height field mask field as 3D height, use [Height Field Project|Node:sop/heightfield_project].

[Include:_heightfield_common#combine]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#blend]
    
Method:
    #id: method
    
    Project:
        Assume the second input is surface geometry, project it "down" onto the terrain to create the mask.
        
    Fog Volume:
        Assume the second input is a fog volume, create the mask where it intersects the terrain.
        
    SDF Volume:
        Assume the second input is an SDF volume, create the mask where it intersects the terrain.

Invert Mask: Invert Mask.
    #id: invertmask
    
    Invert the mask, so the projection/intersection creates a hole in the mask instead.
    
Maximum Distance:
    #id: maxdist
    
    The maximum distance to project before deciding the projection has missed the height field, when __Method__ is "project".

Density:
    #id: density
    
    The value to set the the mask layer to where the geometry projects/intersects.
