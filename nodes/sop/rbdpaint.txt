= RBD Paint =

"""Paints values onto geometry or constraints using strokes."""

This node allows you to interactively paint weaker areas on the geometry in the viewport before applying the [RBD Material Fracture|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] node. This it typically used for concrete and will paint a `density` attribute in the areas you want more fracturing to occur. To see these affects, choose __Scatter From Attribute__ on the [RBD Material Fracture|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] node and specify `density` as the __Attribute Name__.

@parameters

Reset Strokes:
    Clears all recorded strokes in this node.

Output Attribute:
    Specifies the name of the point attribute to paint into.

FG Value:
    The maximum value for strokes made with ((LMB)).

BG Value:
    The maximum value for strokes made with ((MMB)).

Opacity:
    A scale on the __FG Value__. This can be useful to drag into the viewport as a [HUD slider|/basics/hud_sliders] so you can adjust the strength of each stroke on the fly, especially if you don't have a pressure sensitive input device.

Radius:
    The maximum radius of strokes. Pressure sensitive input can scale this value down.

Stroke Method:
    Specifies how to combine the strokes with existing attribute values.

Stroke Quality:
    The sampling rate of the brush stroke. Higher values can capture more detail but use more memory and are slower to display.

Visualize Attribute:
    Toggles visualization of the painted attribute.

Division Size:
    Divides the polygons in the geometry to allow for more precise painting.
