=== Geometry ===

Thickness:
    #id: guide_thicknesscolor

    Draw spheres for the `pscale` of the geometry.   If the geometry has already
    solved it may have set the `overlap_self` attribute, if so, the actual
    effective thickness is drawn in cyan.  This is useful to detect if
    the original thickness was too high - if so the extra thickness will
    be ignored by the simulation and just slow down the collisions.

Extrude:
    #id: guide_showthicknessextrude

    Draw the thickness by offsetting the geometry in opposite directions rather
    than by using spheres.

Failed Self Collision:
    #id: guide_failedself

    Draw failed self collisions as red spheres.  These points will no
    longer collide with their own geometry, nor will any edge or triangle
    attached to them.


Failed External Collision:
    #id: guide_failedexternal

    Draw failed external collisions as orange spheres.  These points will
    no longer collide with external geometry, nor will any edge or triangle
    attached to them.

Welds:
    #id: guide_weldcolor

    Draw which points have been semantically fused together with the
    `weld` attribute.  These can be broken during the solve using
    the auto break options, or by setting `weld` to -1.

Radius Scale:
    #id: guide_colvisscale

    Because the thickness may be small, the visualization spheres can sometimes
    be lost.  This scales the visualization spheres allowing them to
    be readily seen.


=== Constraints ===

Group:
    #id: guide_constraintgroup

    Constraints are often added to different groups.  This allows you to
    isolate one particular group to visualize.


Pin to Target:
    #id: guide_pincolor

    Draw spheres over points pinned to the target animation.

Stitch Points:
    #id: guide_stitchcolor

    Draw stitch constraints of points stitched together.

Attach to Geometry:
    #id: guide_attachcolor

    Draw attachment constraints for points attached to external geometry.

Radius:
    #id: guide_constraintvisradius

    The constraint guides are not scaled by the thickness of the object,
    so this provides an absolute scale for their size.


=== Visualization ===

False Color Mode:
    #id: vis_mode

    Visualize properties of the constraints using a blue-to-red infrared coloring.

    None:
	Leave the original colors.

    Stretch Stress:
	Color according to the maximum stretching force applied by the constraints.

    Bend Stress:
	Color according to the maximum bending force applied by the constraints.

    Stretch Distance:
	Color according to how far constraints are stretched.

    Stretch Ratio:
	Color according the ratio between original and current stretch.

    Bend Angle:
	Color according to how many degrees the bend angle has deviated.

    Stretch Plastic Flow:
	Color according to how much the stretch plastic flow has been triggered.

    Bend Plastic Flow:
	Color according to how much the bend plastic flow has been triggered.

    Volume Stress:
	Color according to the maximum volumetric force applied by the constraints.

    Volume Distance:
	Color according to how far volumetric constraints have expanded from their rest state.

    Volume Ratio:
	Color according the ratio between volumetric expansion and the rest state.


Display Visualization Geometry:
    #id: vis_displaygeo

    Toggles if the simulation geometry is false-colored in addition to the constraints.
