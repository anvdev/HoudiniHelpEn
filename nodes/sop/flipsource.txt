""" Creates a surface or density VDB for sourcing FLIP simulations. """

The FLIP Source SOP converts its input geometry into a volume that can be used
to control simulations. For instance, the generated volume can be used to
inject liquid into a FLIP simulation or act as a sink in a smoke simulation. In
either case, this node can be used in conjunction with the
[Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] DOP to affect simulations. This node
includes several presets to simplify initialization of the operator for common
use cases.

@inputs

Geometry to Source From:
    Input geometry to convert into a volume.

@outputs

Output:
    Generated volume and particles (if __Create Particles__ is enabled).

@parameters

Initialize:
    #id: initialize
    Configures the node according to the selected preset.

Volume Name:
    #id: volumename
    Name of the VDB that is to be created.

    NOTE:
        If the incoming geometry has a signed distance field whose name is the
        same as the value of __Volume Name__, it will be used directly.
        Otherwise, a signed distance field is created for the geometry.

Voxel Size:
    #id: voxelsize
    Voxel size of the created VDB.

Shell Thickness:
    #id: shell shelltickness
    Enabling this option interprets the input geometry as a shell around its
    surface of the given thickness (as opposed to a filled volume).

Output Fog:
    #id: outputfog
    When this option is turned on, a fog VDB is generated instead of a signed
    distance field.

Fog Boost:
    #id: remapfog fogboost
    Enabling this option remaps the generated fog VDB, boosting its values
    towards 1.

Create Particles:
    #id: createparticles
    Seed particles inside of the geometry.

Particle Group:
    #id: particlegroup
    The created points are organized into a group of this name.

Particle Separation:
    #id: particlesep
    The distance between generated particles.

Jitter Seed:
    #id: jitterseed
    Random seed for creating jitter.

Jitter Scale:
    #id: jitterscale
    The amount of jitter to apply to the positional values of the particles.

Oversampling:
    #id: dooversampling oversampling
    The amount to oversample the points within a distance from the zero
    isosurface of the SDF volume, as specified by the __Oversampling
    Bandwidth__.

Oversampling Bandwidth:
    #id: oversamplingbandwidth
    The points will be oversampled to this distance from the zero isosurface of
    the SDF volume. This parameter is specified in multiples of __Particle
    Separation__.

Velocity:
    #id: addvelocity velocity
    When enabled, the seeded particles are endowed with the given velocity
    (stored in the `v` point attribute).

Add Rest Attribute:
    #id: enablerest
    Creates a `rest` attribute set to the particle's current position offset by
    the vector specified in __Rest Offset__.

Dual Rest Attributes:
    #id: dualrestattributes
    Creates a `rest2` attribute in addition to the `rest` attribute, usually
    used in conjunction with the FLIP solver's support for __Dual Rest
    Attributes__.

Rest Offset:
    #id: restoffset
    Offset the current position by this vector before storing in the rest
    attributes.
