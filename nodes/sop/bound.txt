"""Creates a bounding box, sphere, or rectangle for the input geometry."""

You can use the bounding box with the [Lattice node|Node:sop/lattice]
to create a deformation cage for the input geometry.

@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of geometry to bound.
    Group Type:
        The type of elements referenced in the Group field.
    Keep Original:
        Keep the input geometry.
    Create When Bounds Empty:
	If there is no input geometry or the specified group is empty,
	a zero sized bounding box will be created at the origin.  Turning
	this off will cause an empty geometry to be created instead.

    Bounding Type:
        Specifies whether to create a bounding box, sphere, or rectangle.

    Oriented Bounding Box (points only):
        Orients the bounding box to the axes of the input geometry instead of the world axes.

        NOTE:
            This algorithm is based on points and so requires primitives with vertex hulls. It will not work with, for example, a primitive sphere or packed geometry. To get the bounding box of a primitive sphere, first [convert|Node:sop/convert] it to polygons.

    Divisions:
        Number of divisions for the bounding box, along the xyz axes.

    Enforcement Bars:
        Places diagonal crossbars in the divisions of the box.

    Orientation:
        Poles of sphere align with orientation axis.

    Accurate Bounds:
        Use a more accurate (but slower) bounding sphere calculation.

    Minimum Radius:
        Specifies the minimum radius of the bounding sphere.

    Oriented Bounding Rectangle:
        Specifies whether to compute an oriented or axis-aligned bounding rectangle.

    Origin:
        Origin of the projection plane used when computing the bounding rectangle.

    Distance:
        Distance to translate the bounding rectangle's projection plane along its normal.

    Direction:
        The normal vector of the projection plane for the bounding rectangle.

    Lower, Upper Padding:
	The computed bounding box or sphere is enlarged by these
	padding values.  Note that in the case of spheres, non-uniform
	padding values will not guarantee the resulting sphere still
	contains the input geometry.

    Output Transform Attribute:
        Toggles whether the __Transform Attribute__ is added to the geometry.

    Transform Attribute:
        Creates a _detail_ attribute with this name, containing a 4x4 matrix representing the bounding shape's translation and rotation.
        You can this with, for example, [Node:sop/xformbyattrib] to apply or reverse the transformation elsewhere.

    Output Radii Attribute:
        Toggles whether the __Radii Attribute__ is added to the geometry.

    Radii Attribute:
        Creates a _detail_ attribute with this name, describing the extents of the bounding shape.
        For a sphere this contains the X, Y, and Z radii, and for a bounding box or rectangle this contains the half-length along each axis.
