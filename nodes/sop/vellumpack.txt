"""Packs Vellum geometry and constraints into a single geometry."""

The Vellum Pack SOP packs geometry and constraint inputs into a single
geometry.  The output geometry will have a two packed primitives, one
for each of the inputs.  The `vellum_type` string attribute is created
to allow the geometry and constraints to be split up appropriately
when unpacked.

Packing Vellum simulations into a single object makes it a lot easier
to work with them, either using switches or merges they can be treated
as a single wire.   The [Vellum Unpack SOP|Node:sop/vellumunpack] will undo this operation.


@parameters

Name:
    #id: name

    Add a name attribute to the packed primitives.  Useful when merging
    multiple Vellum simulations together to track them when they
    unpack.
