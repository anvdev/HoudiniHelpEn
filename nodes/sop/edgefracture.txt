"""Cuts geometry along edges using guiding curves."""

The Edge Fracture SOP cuts input geometry along existing edges, using curves as a guide for the cuts.  An initial set of polylines can be generated by the Edge Fracture SOP when the __Initial Pieces__ option is enabled, with additional arbitrary curves optionally added in the second input.

@parameters

Initial Pieces:
    #id: initialpieces

    Generate an initial set of polylines for cutting the input geometry into approximately the specified number of pieces.  These polylines are generated with the [Poly Reduce|Node:sop/polyreduce] SOP.

Resample Accuracy:
    #id: resampleres

    Resample any curves from the second input to the specified accuracy relative to the average edge length of the input geometry.

Point Cost Attribute:
    #id: cost

    If given, the specified point attribute on the surface geometry will be added to the cost of a path visiting each point.  By painting these values on the input geometry, you can influence the location of the edge cuts.

Show Guide Geometry:
    #id: showguide

    Show the cutting curves as guide geometry.

Primitive Piece:
    #id: pieceattrib

    A primitive attribute to store a number for each separate piece of geometry.  The Visualization button will create a visualizer for this attribute, showing a different color for each piece.

Original Point Group:
    #id: originalptsgrp

    A point group to store all the original input points before cutting.

New Point Group:
    #id: newptsgrp

    A point group to store any points created in the cutting process.
