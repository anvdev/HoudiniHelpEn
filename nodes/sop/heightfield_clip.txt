"""Limits height values to a certain minimum and/or maximum."""

== Mask layers == (masks)

This node adds two mask layers to the output. The `mesa` layer marks areas where the node leveled the terrain. The `cliffs` layer marks the borders of the clipped regions. You can use these masks in subsequent layers to apply different effects to just the areas that were clipped (or not clipped).


@parameters

== Clipping ==

Compute Range:
    #id: computerange
    
    Click to set the minimum and maximum to the _current_ minimum and maximum values of the input volume.
    
Min Clip:
    #id: minclip
    
    Turn on the checkbox to clip height values below this minimum.
    
Max Clip:
    #id: maxclip
    
    Turn on the checkbox to clip height values above this maximum.
    
Soft Clip Strength:
    #id: clipstrength
    
    The sharpness of the transition from the clipped value to the rest of the volume. 

Soft Clip Scale:
    The unit-height to use in computing soft clipping.  Because soft clipping is designed around unit range, to get very soft clips of height fields this scale needs to be increased.
    
Edge Mask Radius:
    #id: edgemaskradius
    
    Width of the area marked in the edge mask (`cliffs`).
