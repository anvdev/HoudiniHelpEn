"""Computes the post-deform or pre-deform difference of two geometries with similar topologies."""

== Overview ==

This node computes the post-pose deform or pre-pose deform difference of two geometries: rest and example. The geometries must have the same number of vertices and have a similar topology. The post-deform difference method returns the difference vectors between the input geometries. Identical vertices become zero vectors. The pre-deform difference method first transforms the example geometry to the rest-pose by applying inverse skinning method to the deformed geometry. The example geometry has been deformed and edited this node returns the difference vectors as though they were made to the pre-deformed example geometry.

@parameters

Difference Method:
    #id: difftype
    Pre-Deform:
        Transforms the example geometry into the rest-pose by applying inverse skinning method to the example geometry before computing the difference.

    Post-Deform: 
        Computes the difference of specified attribute on the two geometries.

    Post-Deform Orient:
        Produces a similar result as the __Pre-Deform__ method however instead of transforming the example geometry with inverse skinning this method transforms each point by the inverse of the orientation indicated by a quaternion point attribute.

    From Input Geometry:
        When selected the `shapeDiffMethod` global attribute gives the difference method where the string value `predeform` specifies __Pre-Deform__ differencing, `postdeform` specifies __Pose-Deform__ differencing, and `postdeform_orient` specifies __Post-Deform Orient__ differencing. The `shapeDiffOrientAttrib` global attribute also gives the __Orient Attribute__ name.

Orient Attribute:
    #id: orientattrib
    The name of the quaternion point attribute to use with the __Post-Deform Orient__ difference method.

Skeleton Root Path:
    #id: skelrootpath
    Specifies the parent OBJ for the bones attached to the input geometry. The `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute is used by default when this parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute in the input geometry. Relative path values here will be with respect to this node.

Transforms Path:
    An optional path to a CHOP node that contains channels for the world bone transforms, overriding the current state of the bones. In CHOPs, the Extract Bone Transforms node can be used to capture the bone transforms.

    The `deformTransformsPath` detail attribute is used by default when this parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the `deformTransformsPath` detail attribute in the input geometry.

Skinning Method:
    #id: skintype
	The skinning method used to inverse transform the deformed geometry when __Pre-Deform__ differencing. The skinning method should match that used by the upstream [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/bonedeform] that deforms the geometry.

Dual Quaternion Blend Attribute:
    The name of the point attribute to use with the __Blend Dual Quaternion and Linear__ skinning method.

Deform Normals:
    Deforms the point normals to match the deformation of the points.

Deform Vector Attributes:
    Deforms the vector attributes to match the deformation of the points.

Vector Attributes:
    Vector attributes to deform.

Deform Quaternion Attributes:
    Deforms the quaternion attributes to match the deformation of the points.

Quaternion Attributes:
    Quaternion attributes to deform.

Mask Attribute:
    Attribute of the mask from the second input to be used. The first (red) component is used as mask value.

Mask Scale:
    Scales the mask to reduce its effect globally.
