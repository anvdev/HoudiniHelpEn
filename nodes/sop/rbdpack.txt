= RBD Pack =

"""Packs RBD geometry, constraints, and proxy geometry into a single geometry."""

The RBD Pack SOP packs geometry and constraint inputs into a single geometry.
The output geometry will have three packed primitives, one for each of the inputs.
The `rbd_type` string attribute is created to allow the geometry and constraints to be split up appropriately when unpacked.

Packing RBD simulations into a single object makes it a lot easier to work with them, either using switches or merges they can be treated as a single wire.
The [RBD Unpack SOP|Node:sop/rbdunpack] will undo this operation.

@parameters

Name:
    #id: name

    Add an `rbd_name` attribute to the packed primitives.
    Useful when merging multiple simulations together to track them when they unpack.
