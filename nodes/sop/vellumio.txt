"""Packs Vellum simulations, saves them to disk, and loads them back again."""

The Vellum I/O SOP is designed to streamline the common operation
of packing a Vellum stream, saving it to disk, and giving an option
to use the saved sequence rather than the live sequence.

The third input wires directly to the third output and is not cached to disk.

@parameters

Storage Type:
    #id: storage

    Vellum simulations consist of both the geometry being simulated,
    but also the set of constraints applied to the geometry.  In order
    to restart a simulation the constraints are required, but it is
    a lot less storage to only store the raw geometry.

    Geometry Only:
	Store an unpacked sequence of geometry which is just the Vellum
	geometry.  In this mode, the second output will always be empty.

    Packed Geometry and Constraints:
	Pack the incoming geometry and constraints wires into two packed
	primitives.  This pair of packed primitives is then saved as a single
	sequence of geometry, providing access to the potentially animated
	constraints.  The constraints allow the simulation to be restarted and
	allow the visualization of the state of the constraints when loading a
	cached simulation.

	In this mode, the first output and second output will be the
	unpacked geometry and constraints respectively.

Load from Disk     :
    #id: loadfromdisk
    Switches between importing fields from DOPs and loading the fields from the geometry file.

    NOTE:
        If you start a render, it will always use the Import option, ignoring this parameter.

File Mode:
    How this node reads/writes the geometry to/from the disk file.

    This parameter is only enabled when __Load From Disk__ is disabled.

    Automatic:
        Writes the file if it doesn't exist, reads it if it does
        exist.

        This is useful for caching, where the node will
        write the cache to disk the first time it cooks, and
        use the cache file from then on.

        To force a refresh of the cache, manually delete the file
        on disk.

    Read Files:
        Reads the geometry from the file. If the node's input
        is connected, it's ignored.

    Write Files:
        Writes the input geometry to disk.

    No Operation:
        No file access will occur. Pass through the input geometry
        to the output, like a [Null surface node|Node:sop/null].

Geometry File:
    #id: file

    Where to load the fields from when in Load from Disk mode. This also controls where the [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry] will save the fields.

Save to File:
    See the [File Cache SOP|Node:sop/filecache] help for these parameters.

Save Filter:
    See the [File Cache SOP|Node:sop/filecache] help for these parameters.

Load From File:
    See the [File Cache SOP|Node:sop/filecache] help for these parameters.
