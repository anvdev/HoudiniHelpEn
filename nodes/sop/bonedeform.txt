"""Uses capture attributes created from bones to deform geometry according to their movement."""

TIP:
    This node supports the character muscle/joint/etc. deformation
    workflow. To do a cage deformation of geometry, use the
    [Lattice node|Node:sop/lattice].

Bone Deform works in conjunction with a Bone Capture nodes ([Node:sop/capture],
[Node:sop/captureproximity], [Node:sop/bonecapturebiharmonic]) to
deform geometry. As the bones move, this node displaces the points on the
geometry according to the point weights.

Typically one or more Capture Regions are placed in an object (usually a
bone) and named "capture_region". The object is then read into a Capture
operation through the object's hierarchy. The object is moved to deform
the Capture operation's geometry with a Deform operation.

Bone Deform can use Linear, Dual Quaternion or mix both solutions linearly
to compute the deformation.

@parameters

Group:
    Optional point and/or primitive groups to limit the points which are deformed.

Skeleton Root Path:
    Specifies the parent OBJ for the bones attached to the input geometry.
    The `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute is used by default when this
    parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the
    `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute in the input geometry.

Skinning Method:
    #id: method
    Choose the bone deform method.

    Linear Skinning:
	    The standard, fastest method. However, artifacts can occur for twisting geometry between two bones, producing volume loss. To fix these artifacts, introduce additional bones to even out the deformation.
	
    Dual Quaternion Skinning:
	    Dual quaternion skinning is an alternate way of computing the deformation from bones. This method is better for deforming twisting geometry and preventing volume loss than the traditional Linear Skinning method. This is often used for body parts, such as the shoulders of characters.

    Blend Dual Quaternion and Linear Skinning:
	    Blends the deformation computed using both methods together based on a point attribute. For this method, a float point attribute must be supplied in the `Blend Attribute` parameter.  A blend attribute value of 0.0, will use the Linear Skinning solution. A blend attribute value of 1.0 will use the Dual Quaternion solution. A blend value of 0.5 will mix both solutions together evenly.

    From Input Geometry:
        When selected the `deformSkinMethod` global attribute gives the method where the string value `linear` specifies __Linear Skinning__ skinning, `dualquat` specifies __Dual Quaternion Skinning__ skinning, and `blenddualquat` specifies __Blend Dual Quaternion and Linear Skinning__ skinning. The `deformDualQuaternionBlendAttrib` global attribute also gives the __Blend Attribute__ name.

Blend Attribute:
    The name of the point attribute to use when blending dual quaternion and
    linear solutions together.

Transforms Path:
    An optional path to a CHOP node that contains channels for
    the world bone transforms, overriding the current state of the
    bones. In CHOPs, the Extract Bone Transforms node can be used
    to capture the bone transforms.

    The `deformTransformsPath` detail attribute is used by default when this
    parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the
    `deformTransformsPath` detail attribute in the input geometry.

Other Attributes:
    Name of other attributes (beyond positions and normals) to deform.
    This is typically a list of attribute names separated by spaces but pattern
    characters such as '*' can also be used match multiple attributes. The
    interpretation of the attribute data is taken by their type qualifier such
    as "Position", "Vector", "Normal". or "Quaternion". Attributes which don't
    have these type qualifiers will be ignored.
    
Deform Normals:
    Deforms the normals to match the deformation of the points.

Delete Capture Attributes:
    Delete capture attributes lighten the geometry data such as `boneCapture`,
    `pCaptAlpha`, `pCaptSkelRoot`, `pCaptFrame`.
    
Delete Point Colors:
    Delete point color attribute to lighten the geometry data.
