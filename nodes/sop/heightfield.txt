"""Generates an initial heightfield volume for use with terrain tools."""

This node generates two 2D volume primitives, `height` and `mask`, with a given resolution and initial value, to be modified by other terrain nodes.

* The `height` volume is a 2D grid of values representing the distance of the terrain at each point on the map from the ground plane (the values can be negative).

* The `mask` volume can be used as the "mask" input to other terrain tools. It specifies which areas the terrain node's effect should apply to: where the mask has a value of 0, the node has no effect, and where the mask has a value of 1, the node has full effect. Terrain nodes let you paint masks or generate them from information about the terrain (for example, where shadows fall, or areas below a certain height).

If you wire this node's output geometry into a terrain node's first input, it will operate on the `height` volume. If you wire this node's output into a terrain node's "mask" input, it will use the `mask` volume to scale the effect.

NOTE:
    You should think of Houdini units as meters when you enter the scale and the initial height. The height field tools and Houdini dynamics assume that units are meters.


@parameters

Orientation:
    #id: orient
    
    The initial axis alignment of the 2D volume in world space. The default is ZX, aligned with the "ground" plane.

Sampling:
    #id: sampling

    Where the center of voxels should lie, with respect to the given size.
    When Height Field Convert converts to polygons, these are the location
    of the points generated.

Initial Height:
    #id: initialheight
    
    The initial value of the height volume, in meters. The default is 0.
    
Initial Mask:
    #id: initialmask
    
    The initial value of the mask volume. The default is 0.

Division Mode:
    #id: divisionmode
    
    Controls whether you will set the volume resolution by number of samples or spacing distance.
    
    By Axis:
        Takes the longest axis and divides it into the specified number of samples.
        
    By Size:
        Places samples the given distance apart, filling up the requested terrain size.

Grid Samples:
    #id: gridsamples
    
    The number of grid points along each axis, when __Division mode__ is "by axis".

Grid Spacing:
    #id: gridspacing
    
    The space between grid points, in meters, when __Division mode__ is "by size".
    
Uniform Scale:
    #id: scale
    
    Scales the size of the volumes.
    
Size:
    #id: size
    
    The width and height of the volumes, in meters.
    
Center:
    #id: t
    
    Position on the center of the volumes in world space.
