"""Extrudes surface geometry into a volume."""

This operation is used to create a volume out of surface geometry.  This can be useful for creating physical objects such as terrain features.

The second output provides the base of the extrusion.  This can be feathered
and lifted to form a collision object when this is used to be build
a sand or liquid volume.

@parameters

Depth:
	#id: depth

	The amount by which the geometry is extruded.  
	
	Positive values indicate an extrusion above the given surface, 
	negative values an extrusion below it.

Base Normal:
	#id: basenormal

	The direction in which the extrusion takes place.

Flatten Base:
	#id: flat

	Whether or not the surface resulting from the extrusion is made 
	into a flat plane.

Base Padding:
	Amount to grow the final ring of the base.  Expressed as a fraction, so
	0.1 means 10% bigger.

Base Lift:
	Amount in distance to lift up the final ring of the base.

Top Group:
    #id: topgrp
    
    Primitive group for the polygons forming the top, original surface, of the
    extrusion.

Base Group:
    #id: basegrp
    
    Primitive group for the polygons forming the base of the extrusion.

Side Group:
    #id: sidegrp
    
    Primitive group for the polygons forming the sides of the extrusion.

Top Boundary Group:
    #id: topseamgrp

    Edge group for the edges bordering the top and side of the extrusion.

Base Boundary Group:
    #id: baseseamgrp

    Edge group for the edges bordering the base and side of the extrusion.
