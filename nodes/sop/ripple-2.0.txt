@parameters

Group:
    The set of points to deform with the ripple.
Orientation:
    The center of the ripples will be scattered on a plane with
    this orientation.
Use Center:
    Adjust the first ripple to coincide witih this location in space.
Center:
    Where to move the first ripple to.  Note all ripples are displaced
    by this amount, so the grid being scattered in will be offset
    around this point.
Wave Length:
    Distance between peaks of ripples.
Wave Height:
    Maximum height of ripple above surface.
Wave Decay:
    How quickly the ripples drop off with distance.
Wave Speed:
    The ripples are animated.  This controls how quickly the waves propagate.
Num Ripples:
    This number of ripples are randomly placed in a square whose sides are Ripple Source Area.  The square is centered at the origin unless the Use Center is selected.  Then it is offset to make the first ripple lie at that given center point (this is not the same as centering the square at that point)
Ripple Source Area:
    Size of sides of the square to randomly place ripples in.
Random Seed:
    The randomly selected ripples will use this as a seed, different
    integer numbers will give different placements & timings of ripples.
Up Direction:
    The direction to displace geometry in.
