"""Repacks geometry as an embedded primitive."""

== Repacking Geometry ==

This SOP takes the input geometry and repackages Packed Alembic and Packed Disk
primitives as Packed Geometry primitives.

@parameters
Group:
    #channels: /group

    The group of primitives to repack. If this is blank, all primitives will be
    repacked.

Repack Packed Fragments:
    #channels: /packedfragments

    When enabled, packed fragment primitives will be repacked as packed
    geometry primitives.
