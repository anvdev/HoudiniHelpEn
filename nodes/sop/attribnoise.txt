""" Adds noise to attributes of the incoming geometry. """

The Attribute Noise SOP provides a simple interface for adding coherent noise
to attributes, without needing to create VOP networks or write VEX code. All of
the models provided by the [Unified Noise|Node:vop/unifiednoise] VOP can be
used with this node. Attribute Noise also allows for fine control over the
generated noise values, as the values can be remapped to match a desired
distribution.

@inputs

Input:
    Geometry whose points to add noise to.

@outputs

Output:
    Modified geometry.

@parameters

Mode:
    #id: mode
    In __Additive__ mode, noise is added to the attribute value, whereas the
    final value is obtained through multiplication in __Multiplicative__ mode.

Signature:
    #id: signature
    Dimensionality of the generated noise. If set to __1D__, the same noise
    value is used for all three components of vector attributes. If set to
    __3D__, the first noise component is used with scalar attributes.

Location Attribute:
    #id: locattrib
    Noise for each point is produced by sampling a volumetric field using the
    value of this vector attribute. If this parameter is set to `P`, the
    applied noise pattern will vary based on the motion of the points. If this
    is undesirable, a `rest` attribute can be added to the input geometry and
    its value used instead.

Attributes:
    #id: attribs
    An attribute's value will be affected if its name matches this pattern.
    The node will also create an attribute of the same size as __Signature__
    for each valid token of this string that does not name an existing
    attribute.

    NOTE:
        This node only applies noise to `float` and `vector` attributes.

    NOTE:
        An attribute will be created for a token only if the token matches the
        overall pattern. For example, setting __Attributes__ to "boat ^boat"
        will not create an attribute named "boat".

Group:
    #id: group
    Only points in this group will be affected by noise.

== Noise ==

Animated:
    #id: animated
    If this option is turned on, produced noise will vary with time.

Noise Type:
    #id: basis
    The method used for generating noise.

Center Noise:
    #id: centernoise
    Shifts the generated noise to be centered about 0. The output range is
    still equal to __Amplitude__.

Amplitude:
    #id: amp1 amp3x amp3y amp3z
    The amount of added noise (range of generated values).

Remap Noise:
    #id: remap
    When this option is enabled, noise values are remapped to match the
    provided __Distribution__.

Minimum:
    #id: outmin1 outmin3x outmin3y outmin3z
    The minimum noise value after remapping.

Maximum:
    #id: outmax3 outmax3x outmax3y outmax3z
    The maximum noise value after remapping.

Distribution:
    #id: pdf
    The desired distribution of noise. Horizontal axis covers the range from
    __Minimum__ to __Maximum__.

    NOTE:
        For three dimensional noise, all components will be remapped to match
        this distribution.

Pulse Duration:
    #id: pulseduration
    Time rate of change of the noise pattern is inversely proportional to
    __Pulse Duration__; only available when __Animated__ is enabled.

Temporal Period:
    #id: tperiod
    Amount of time before the noise pattern repeats; only available for
    periodic noise types.

Element Size:
    #id: elementsize
    Controls base feature size of the generated noise.

Element Scale:
    #id: elementscalex elementscaley elementscalez
    Feature size along each axis is governed by the product of __Element
    Size__ with the applicable component of this parameter.

Spatial Period:
    #id: speriodx speriody speriodz
    Size of the repeating noise pattern; only available for periodic noise
    types.

Offset:
    #id: offsetx offsety offsetz
    Offset within the evaluated noise field. Can be used as a seed to modify
    the noise values without affecting the overall look of the pattern.

== Fractal ==

Fractal Type:
    #id: fractal
    Composites noise layers of different frequencies to obtain a final pattern
    with details at various scales.

Max Octaves:
    #id: oct
    Specifies the number of composited noise layers.

Lacunarity:
    #id: lac
    Determines the frequency difference between successive noise layers.

Roughness:
    #id:
    Controls influence falloff for each successive noise layer.

== Warping ==

Enable Lattice Warp:
    #id: dolwarp
    Adds "stringiness" or "wiriness" to standard noise.

Enable Gradient Warp:
    #id: dogwarp
    Widens the peaks or valleys of the noise output.

== Post-Process ==

Minimum:
    #id: clampmin minval
    If enabled, final attribute values are clamped to the specified __Minimum__
    after noise is applied. For vector attributes, the same lower bound is used
    for all components.

Maximum:
    #id: clampmax maxval
    If enabled, final attribute values are clamped to the specified __Maximum__
    after noise is applied. For vector attributes, the same upper bound is used
    for all components.
