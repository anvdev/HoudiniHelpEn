"""Assigns channel paths and/or pickscripts to geometry."""

== Overview ==

The Pose Scope node assigns channel paths and/or pickscripts to a list or group of primitives. The [Pose Tool|Node:obj_state/pose] uses this attribute for selection.

Under the hood, the node creates [attributes|/model/attributes] named `pose_scope` or the name provided (setting the attribute to a list of strings containing either pathnames of channels or pickscripts specified using .json). 

@parameters

Attribute Name:
    Name of the attribute. Default is `pose_scope`.

Items:
    The number of primitive groups to add the `pose_scope` attribute to.

Group:
    A subset of primitives in the input geometry to add the attribute to. Patterns can be used to specify the [/model/groups].

Channels:
    The paths of the channels to assign. Click the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser icon to choose the channels from a list.

Pickscript:
    Turn this on if you want to add a pickscript to the group

Label:
    A label for the pickscript.

Language:
    Which language the script will be in. Can be hscript or python.

Script:
    Pickscript to be applied.


== Using invisible rigs ==(includeme)

    Inserting a Pose Scope node in your skin geometry network will allow you to set up the `pose_scope` attribute so that you can pose geometry in the viewport without using handles. You can create groups of geometry, which you can assign channels to using Pose Scope, then click directly in the viewport and drag to pose. 
    
    This improves workflow and makes character animation easier by removing clutter from the viewport. Complicated rigs can have hundred of controllers, which can make animating quite difficult. Hiding these controls and using invisible rigs allows you to click and drag parts of the character in the viewport, which makes animating feel more like working with a stop motion puppet.
    
    The following example uses the the [Simple Female|Node:obj/simplefemale] shelf tool.
    
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ/simplefemale][Simple Female|Node:obj/simplefemale] tool on the __Characters__ shelf.
    
    # Navigate to the __Display__ tab and turn off __Show Controls__.
    
        [Image:/images/char/pose1.png]
        [Image:/images/char/pose2.png]
    
    # ((RMB)) the `simplefemale1` node in the network editor, and select __Allow Editing of Contents__.
    
    # Double-click to dive inside the `simplefemale1` node and then double-click the `geo_skin` node to dive inside that network.
    
        NOTE:
            If you click ((MMB)) the [File node|/Node:sop/file], you will see that this character already has the `pose_scope` attribute. However, for the sake of this example we will pretend that she doesn't.
            
    # Insert a [Group SOP|Node:sop/group] above the last [Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform].
    
    # Give the group a name, for example `l_hand`, click the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/reselect] selection button in the __Base Group__ parameter, select the left hand geometry in the viewport, and press ((Enter)).
    
            [Image:/images/ui/invisible_handles1.png]
    
    # Insert a [Pose Scope SOP|Node:sop/posescope] between the [Group SOP|Node:sop/group] you just created and the last [Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform].
    
    # Select the __Group__ you just created (`l_hand`) from the drop down menu. You can create groups for all body parts.
    
        NOTE:
            You can create groups directly in the pose scope tool, but the recommended workflow is to create separate group nodes. This will make the parameters easier to read, since you will see the names of groups as opposed to a long string of numbers. You can also list multiple groups in this parameter.
    
    # Use the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] node chooser menu to select channels to apply to the group. For this example, we chose the translate and rotate channels.
    
    # Navigate back to the object level, and click the [Icon:TOOLS/pose][Pose|/shelf/pose] tool in the [Toolbox menu|/basics/ui#toolbox] to pose your character interactively in the viewport. Selecting the geometry will pop-up a wheel which will allow you to easily switch between the channels you assigned.
    
        [Image:/images/ui/invisible_handles2.png]
        
        If the group has more than one channel, a pop-up wheel will allow you to easily toggle between the channels. For example, the simple female character has both translate and rotate abilities on her hand.
    
    NOTE:
        The selection flag of the skin geometry must be turned off for invisible rigs to work.
