= RBD Interior Detail =

"""Creates additional detail on the interior surfaces of fractured geometry."""

This SOP creates additional detail on the interior surfaces of fractured geometry, which can be used to produce more interesting high resolution geometry.
The amount of noise added to the points can be scaled based on their distance from the original surface.

TIP:
    The [Transform Pieces SOP|Node:sop/xformpieces] can be used to transform high resolution pieces according to the motion of simulated low resolution pieces.

@inputs
    Geometry:
	The geometry to add interior detail to.

    Constraint Geometry:
        Optional input to pass through constraint geometry (for example, from the [Voronoi Fracture SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracture]).

    Proxy Geometry:
        Optional input to pass through proxy geometry.

    Optional SDF for Depth Sampling:
	An optional SDF Volume, usually created by [IsoOffset|Node:sop/isooffset], to use for depth sampling when scaling the amount of noise added to the geometry.
	If not connected, this node will generate a default one.

@outputs

Geometry:
    The high-resolution geometry.

Constraint Geometry:
    The constraint geometry from the __Constraint Network__ input.

Proxy Geometry:
    The geometry from the __Proxy Geometry__ input, or the original __Geometry__ input if no proxy geometry already exists.

@parameters

Interior Group:
    Specifies the primitives to add detail to. Typically, this group should contain only the interior polygons created by the fracturing process so that the original surface is not affected.

=== Geometry ===

Add Detail:
    Specifies whether the interior surface should be divided according to the __Detail Size__.
    Disabling this allows noise to be applied to interior surfaces that do not need any further subdivision.

Detail Size:
    The size of the polygons added to the interior surfaces.

Compute Interior Normals:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the interior geometry, so that they will have a cusped appearance.

Interior Cusp Angle:
    Computes vertex normals on the edges of the interior geometry with angles greater than this angle, so that they will have a cusped appearance.

Triangulate Non-Planar Detail:
    Triangulates any non-planar polygons produced while adding detail.

=== Noise Settings ===

Noise Amplitude:
    #id: noiseamp
    Scales the amount of displacement.

Noise Type:
    #id: noisetype
    The type of noise added to the interior points.

=== Displacement Scaling ===

Visualize Noise Scale:
    Adds color to the geometry to indicate the amount of noise applied at each point.

Depth Volume Resolution:
    Resolution of the default depth sampling SDF.
    The amplitude of the noise added to the interior points is scaled by the depth of the point within the surface of the original geometry, calculated by sampling an SDF of the geometry.
    If an SDF is not connected to the fourth input of the SOP, a default one will be created at this resolution.

Clamp Displacement Amount to Depth:
    Limit the amount of displacement done at a point by its depth within the surface.

    When adding high amplitude noise to the interior points, it's possible that the interior surface could interpenetrate the exterior.
    This option will clamp the amount of displacement at a particular point by the depth within the surface.

Clamp Depth Percentage:
    The percentage of the depth within the surface to which the displacement should be clamped.

    Because an SDF is not a perfect representation of depth, this option allows you to clamp to a percentage of the depth.
    Lowering this can guarantee no interpenetration, at the expense of more clamping of the interior noise.

Use Depth/Noise Ramp:
    Use a ramp control for more precise control of the depth/noise mapping.

Depth/Noise Bias:
    The value for the bias curve that maps depth within the surface to the amplitude of the noise applied.

Depth/Noise Ramp:
    The ramp that maps from depth within the surface to the amplitude of the noise applied.
