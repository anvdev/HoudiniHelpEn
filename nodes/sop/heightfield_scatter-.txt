= HeightField Scatter =

"""Scatters points across the surface of a height field."""

This node generates point geometry from a height field.

WARNING:
    The node will _only_ scatter points where the __Scatter amount layer__ is on. If the layer is empty, or the parameter is left blank, the node won't create any points at all.


@parameters

Scatter Amount Layer:
    #id: layer
    
    The name of a mask layer specifying which areas of the height field will get scattered points.
    
Use Exact Point Count:
    #id: dopointcount
    
    Specify the exact number of points to generate, rather than a density value.
    
Point Count:
    #id: npts
    
    When __Use exact point count__ is on, the number of points to generate.
    
Density:
    #id: densityscale
    
    When __Use exact point count__ is off, the number of points per square meter to generate.
    

== Relaxation ==

Relax Points:
    #id: relaxpoints
    
    Pushes points away from each other as a secondary step, to prevent clumping.
    
Relax Iterations:
    #id: relaxiterations
    
    When __Relax points__ is on, the number of iterations of relaxation to do. More iterations will more evenly distribute the points, but can be slower, and after a certain number of iterations that evenly distribute the points, more iterations is wasted effort.
    
Scale Radii By:
    #id: scaleradiiby
    
    When __Relax points__ is on, scale point radii by this amount before relaxing. A value less than 1 will _increase_ clumping. A value of 0 does no relaxation. A value greater than 1 may speed up convergence of the relaxation when scattered points are very far apart.

Use Max Relax Radius:
    #id: usemaxradius
    
    Prevent far-flung outlier points from affecting relaxation.
    
Max Relax Radius:
    #id: maxradius
    
    Points this far from other points are not included in relaxation. Decrease this if outlier points in low-density areas are causing problems with relaxation.

Global Seed:
    #id: seed
    
    Seed for the random number generator. Using the same seed always produces the same scattering. For example, you can change the value to get a different scattering, or set it `$F` to get a different scattering on every frame.

Max Points:
    #id: emergencylimit
    
    An optional hard limit on the number of points to generate, to prevent accidents where you mistype a value and Houdini tries to generate a ridiculous number of points that locks up the computer.
