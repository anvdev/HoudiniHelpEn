"""Calculates the effect of thermal erosion on terrain for a short time."""

Thermal weathering is caused by frozen rocks thawing and breaking, causing features to wear down and smooth out, and material to pile up on the bottom of inclines.

Thermal erosion is more prevalent in regions exposed to a lot of sunlight, because larger day-to-day temperature variations lead to more frequent freezing and thawing.

Thermal erosion is computed by comparing the height field (including debris) against a blurred version of the height field. If the current height is greater than the blurred height, it is eroded proportionally to its sunlight exposure. Thermal erosion is a relaxation process.

@parameters

== Erosion ==

Global Erosion Rate:
    #id: globalerosionrate
    
    Controls how many meters of the eroding layer or material layer is eroded every iteration.
    
Erodability:
    #id: erodability
    
    Controls the softness of the eroding layer or material layer. Higher values would make the terrain easier to erode, causing deeper incisions, more sediment, and more debris being deposited as a result.

erodabilitymaskmode:
	#id: erodabilitymaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for erodability or not.
	
Erodability Mask:
	#id: erodabilitymasklayer
	
	The name of the erodability mask.
	
Erosion Rate:
    #id: erosionrate
    
    Controls the rate at which erosion happens. This is a multiplier on `Erodability`.

Removal Rate:
    #id: removalrate
    
    Proportion of debris from thermal erosion that is deleted. This simulates wind carrying away a certain amount of debris rather than it all accumulating. The default is `0` (no deletion). Negative values correspond to the debris being less dense than the rock, so one unit of eroded rock produces more than one unit of debris.

Cut Angle:
    #id: cutangle
    
    Set the angle at which the thermal erosion would stop cutting beyond. A lower angle would make the cuts flatter and allow for more erosion to take place.

cutanglemaskmode:
	#id: cutanglemaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for cut angle or not.
	
Cut Angle Mask:
	#id: cutanglemasklayer
	
	The name of the cut angle mask.
	
Random Seed:
    #id: seed
    
    Random seed to make erosion vary for the same set of variables on the same input.

== Flow ==

Grid Bias:
	#id: gridbias
	
	Controls how biased the movement of material is. Setting it to positive values would bias the movement in the direction of the principal axes, and when set to negative values, it would bias the movement at angles of 45 degree relative to the principal axes. The default value of zero would mean no bias in any direction.

gridbiasmaskmode:
	#id: gridbiasmaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for grid bias or not.
	
Grid Bias Mask:
	#id: gridbiasmasklayer
	
	The name of the grid bias mask.

Quantization:
	#id: quant
	
	Controls the chunkiness of the material flow. A lower value would make the flow more continuous and a higher value would make the flow more chunky.
	
Spread Iterations:
    #id: settle_iterations
    
    How many iterations of slumping to simulate. Fast-moving slump layers like water or gravel should use a higher value, while lava or rock should use a lower value.
	
Max Debris Depth:
    #id: maxdebrisdepth
    
    Stop erosion when the debris layer reaches this depth.

Repose Angle:
    #id: settle_repose
    
    The maximum slope, measured in degrees from the horizontal, at which the slump layer will remain in place without sliding. To simulate water set this to 0 degrees. For realistic dirt or rock layers, this should be between 30 and 45 degrees.

Stability Mask:
	#id: stabilitymasklayer
	
	The name of the stability mask. This mask can be used to make to debris more stable.

== Bindings ==

Material Layer:
    #id: materiallayer
    
    Mask field marking on which parts of the heightfield to simulate slumping. Default is `debris`.

Eroding Layer:
    #id: erodinglayer
    
    Name of the field to use as the eroding layer in the simulation. Default is `height`.
    
Below Layers:
    #id: belowlayers

    When eroding a system with more than two layered heightfields, the effective height at a point may be the sum of multiple heightfields. This is a space-separated list of of all the layers below the __Eroding Layer__ (default ``).

Bedrock:
    #id: bedrocklayer
    
    Name of the field to use as bedrock in the simulation. Default is `bedrock`.
	
== Strata ==

Adjust Erodability by Strata:
    Adjusts how erodible rock is by how far it is away from the reference
    bedrock layer.

Strata Depth:
    The depth for the strata.  The Strata Erodability ramp uses this depth
    to control how deep it represents.   A positive values means the strata
    represents hardness below the bedrock layer.  Negative values mean
    the strata represents hardness above the bedrock layer.

Clamp at Strata Bounds:
    Depths outside of the strata range will be clamped to the ends of the
    ramp.  If clamping is off, they will repeat forming a periodic pattern.

Strata Erodability:
    How erodible rocks are at different strata depths.  The left most
    is at the bedrock reference layer, the right most at the extreme
    strata depth.  Values of 1 are fully erodible, such as loose dirt,
    and values of 0 prevent erosion, like granite.
