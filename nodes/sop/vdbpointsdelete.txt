= VDB Points Delete =

"""Deletes points inside of VDB Points primitives."""

The VDB Points primitive contains points that are not directly
accessible through most operators.   The VDB Points Delete SOP allows
one to delete points belonging to point groups.


@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The group of VDB primitives to delete points within.   If these
    are not VDB Points primitives, they are ignored.
    
    
VDB Points Groups:
    #id: vdbpointsgroups

    Named groups inside the VDB Points that should be deleted.
    
    
Invert:
    #id: invert

    Normally all points in the group are deleted.  If inverted,
    all the points not in the group will be deleted.
    
    
Drop Points Groups:
    #id: dropgroups

    When all points inside a group are deleted, this will eliminate
    the group as well.
