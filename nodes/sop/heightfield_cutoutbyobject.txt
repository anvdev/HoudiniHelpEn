= HeightField Cutout by Object =

"""Creates a cutout on a terrain based on geometry."""

The `Alpha` layer of a terrain can be used to cutout a non-rectangular
shape for display.   The cutout occurs at a `0.5`, but some care should
be taken to ensure the value varies smoothly to avoid a wavy cutout.

This node converts the geometry into a matching resolution VDB, if 
it is not already a VDB, and then sets the `Alpha` layer to be displayed
if it is inside the object.

@parameters

== Cutting Options ==

Invert:
    #id: invert

    Set `Alpha` to one outside of the object rather than inside.
    
    
Combine:
    #id: combine

    How to merge with any existing `Alpha`.  If no layer exists,
    a layer of value `1` will be created.
    
    Replace:
	Ignore previous values.
        
    Intersect:
	Minimum of the two values, so only present where both are present.
        
    Union:
	Maximum of the two values, so present where either are present.
        
    Subtract:
	Minimum of the old value an complement of the new value - this
	will bite out the new object from the previous cutout.
        
    
Crop to Bounds:
    #id: crop

    Adjusting the `Alpha` layer is purely a visual effect - the terrain
    will continue to exist over all the clipped values.  When cropping
    is enabled, the terrain will be shrunk to the smallest rectangular
    region that is active.
    
    
== Layer Bindings ==

Alpha Layer:
    #id: alphalayer

    Which layer to apply the cut out changes.  The standard visualizers
    will use `Alpha` for clipping.
    
Height Layer:
    #id: heightlayer
    
    Which layer to use for height computation.  To find if a voxel is
    inside the object, it has be lifted from the ground plane by
    the height value.
