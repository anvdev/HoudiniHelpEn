= RBD Constraints From Lines =

"""Creates rigid body constraint geometry from interactively drawn lines in the viewport."""


== Overview == 

This node allows you to create and edit constraints between pieces in the viewport, as you can simply draw constraints between the pieces you want to be connected. Once the constraint is drawn, you can choose the __Connection Type__ to determine how the constraints are set up.

:task: Create a new connection line:
    ((Shift + LMB)) drag.
    
:task: Edit a connection line:
    ((MMB)) drag.

:task: Delete a connection:
    ((Ctrl + LMB)) click the connection.
    
:task: Edit hinge position:
    ((LMB)) drag the hinge.

:task: Slide hinge position along the constraint line.
    ((MMB)) drag along the line.

:task: Switch between line and hinge tools:
    Press ((1)).

:task: Switch between edit and transform handle:
    Press ((2)).

@inputs

Geometry:
    Input geometry to create constraints for.

Constraint Geometry:
    Constraint geometry to be merged with.

Proxy Geometry:
    Proxy geometry. The constraints will be built using this geometry when available.

@parameters

Connection Type:
    Surface Points:
        Creates constraints connecting closest points from nearby pieces.
    Hinges:
        Creates 0 length 2 point prim constraints placed at the intersection of the 2 surfaces.
    Center of Mass:
        Creates constraints connecting centroids of nearby pieces.
Hinge Length:
    Specify the length of the hinge constraint.
Create Group:
    Add the created constraints to a primitive group.
Group Name:
    The name of the primitive group to create.
Show Object Link:
    When the connection type is set to __Surface Points__ or __Hinges__, displays links to the pieces' centroids to help identify them.

Clear Lines:
    Delete all drawn lines.

Clear Hinge Edits:
    Remove all hinge constraint edits.

Show Constraint Link:
    Display a dotted line connecting the drawn line to the center of the constraint.
