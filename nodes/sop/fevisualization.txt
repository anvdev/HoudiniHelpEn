= FEM Visualization =

This allows you to visualize various aspects of an FEM simulation.
The visualization covers mesh quality, inverted tets, energy density, FEM node forces, and collision. For the visualization of an aspect to work, it is required that the corresponding attribute is generated by the FEM object that is visualized. For example, to see energy densities, it is required that __Create Energy Attributes__ is enabled on the FEM Object.

@parameters

Type:
    Allow choice between visualization of mesh quality, tet inversions, energy density, FEM node forces, and collisions.

== Scale ==

Energy Density Scale:
    This is a multiplier for the energy density that is used to map energy density to colors.

Power Density Scale:
    This is a multiplier that is used to calibrate the color range generated for energy dissipation

Force Scale:
    This is a multiplier that is used to compute the colors from FEM node forces

== Filter ==

Collision Pass:
    When visualizing collisions, this specifies the collision pass that is visualized

== Clip Interior ==
    
Enable Clip:
    Clip the mesh to look a visualization of the inside. Useful for sims with tet meshes.

Origin:
    The origin of the clipping plane

Distance:
    The distance of the clipping plane from the origin in the direction of the normal

Direction:
    The normal direction of the clipping plane
