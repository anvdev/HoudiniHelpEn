= Test Geometry: Tommy =

"""Creates a soldier, which can be used as test geometry."""

Test geometry provides some built in geometry to prototype and experiment with. Not only does it provide a more interesting starting point than a torus, but it is also more representative of the sort of geometry your effect will have to deal with: multiple components, and interesting geometry.

NOTE:
    Tommy hopes one day to move on his own. Until then, it's up to you to take him to new places and see new things.
