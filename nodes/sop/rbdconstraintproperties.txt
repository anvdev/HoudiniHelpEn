"""Creates attributes describing rigid body constraints."""

This SOP creates attributes on the input constraint geometry to describe the Bullet constraint types that they [represent|Node:dop/constraintnetwork].

@parameters

Constraint Group:
    The primitives in the constraint geometry to edit constraint attributes for.

Constraint Type:
    #id: constrainttype
    Specifies the type of constraint (such as glue or soft) to use for the primitives in the __Constraint Group__.

Degrees of Freedom:
    #id: constraintdof
    Specifies whether the constraint affects position, orientation, or both.
    This does not apply to glue constraints, which work by simulating glued chunks together as a single object with a compound collision shape.

Constraint Name:
    #id: glue_constraintname
    Specifies the __Data Name__ of the constraint data (for example, the [Glue Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/glueconrel]) to use in the DOP network.

[Include:/nodes/dop/glueconrel#strength]

Strength Variance:
    #id: glue_strengthvariance
    Randomly varies the strength of each glue bond.

[Include:/nodes/dop/glueconrel#impulse_halflife]

[Include:/nodes/dop/glueconrel#propagate_rate]

[Include:/nodes/dop/glueconrel#propagationiterations]

Switch Constraint Type When Broken:
    #id: usenextconstraint
    Specifies a different constraint type to switch to if the glue constraint is broken by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].
