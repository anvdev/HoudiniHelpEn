"""Extracts geometry from agent primitives for a Vellum simulation."""

This SOP unpacks [agent primitives|/crowds/agents] for Vellum simulations and provides several higher-level features on top of the [Agent Unpack SOP|Node:sop/agentunpack], such as separating the simulation geometry from collision geometry and performing a pre-roll.

If the agent shape to be simulated contains a Vellum setup from the [Vellum Pack SOP|Node:sop/vellumpack], attributes on the simulation and constraint geometry will be updated to ensure correct behavior for agents that have been copied or transformed.
This includes scaling the constraints' rest lengths for agents that have been scaled, and adjusting the point numbers for welds and attachment constraints when multiple agents are being unpacked.

@parameters

== Agents ==

Select By:
    Specifies how to select the agents that will be unpacked and simulated.

Group:
    Point or primitive group specifying the subset of agents to unpack.

Layer Names:
    Any agents whose [current layer|/crowds/agents#layer] matches this pattern will be unpacked.

== Geometry ==

Shapes to Simulate:
    Any agent shapes matching this pattern will be unpacked as simulation geometry for the first output.
    Otherwise, the shape will be unpacked as collision geometry for the third output.
    If the simulated shapes contain packed primitives with the `vellum_type` primitive attribute (i.e. from the [Vellum Pack SOP|Node:sop/vellumpack]), the simulation geometry and constraint geometry will be split into the first and second geometry outputs.

Delete Attributes:
    Specifies a list of attributes to delete from the unpacked geometry.
    This can be useful for removing attributes that are not needed for downstream operations, such as capture attributes.

[Include:/nodes/sop/agentunpack#transferattributes]

[Include:/nodes/sop/agentunpack#transfergroups]

== Pre-Roll ==

Vellum Start Frame:
    Specifies the start frame that will be used for the Vellum simulation.
    If this is earlier than the __Crowd Start Frame__, a pre-roll will occur.

Crowd Start Frame:
    Specifies the initial frame of the input agents.

Use Rest Clip:
    If enabled, the pre-roll will blend each agent from the pose specified by the __Rest Clip__ and __Clip Time__ to the agent's pose at the __Crowd Start Frame__.
    Otherwise, the pre-roll will blend from the agent's undeformed (rest) geometry to the deformed geometry at the __Crowd Start Frame__.

Rest Clip:
    Specifies the clip to use when __Use Rest Clip__ is enabled.

Clip Time:
    Specifies the clip time to use when __Use Rest Clip__ is enabled.
