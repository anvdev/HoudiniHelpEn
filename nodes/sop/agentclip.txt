= Agent Clip =

"""Adds new clips to agent primitives."""

This adds additional [animation clips|/crowds/agents] to an agent primitive's definition for driving its skeleton.

When loading a clip from a CHOP or a file, the channels within the clip should
be of the form `transform_name:channel_name` where `transform_name` is a string
matching the values found by calling the [Vex:agenttransformnames]() VEX
function and `channel_name` is one of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz`, `sx`,
`sy`, or `sz`. The channels starting with `t` denote translation, `r` denote
rotation, and `s` denote scale. The resulting transforms will be treated as
_local_ transforms, such as those returned by the [Vex:agentlocaltransforms]
VEX function (ie. they are relative to the corresponding parent transform in
the agent's skeleton).

@parameters

Group:
    The agent primitives in the input geometry that should be modified.

Set Current Clip:
    Changes the current animation clip of the agent. This can be useful for previewing new clips.

Set Clip Time:
    Sets the current time of the agent's animation clip.

Clip Time:
    The current time for the agent's animation clip.

Apply Clip Locomotion:
    If enabled, applies the clip's `__locomotion__` transform so that you can easily test locomotive clips.

[Include:/nodes/chop/extractlocomotion#locomotionorient]

Reload:
    Reloads the clips.

Clips:
    The number of clips to add.

Name:
    #id: name

    The name to identify the clip.
    All clips in an agent definition must have unique names.

Source:
    #id: source

    The source to use for the clip to add.

    Character Rig:
        Creates an animation clip from a character subnetwork/asset in the scene.
    FBX:
        The disk path to an [FBX file|/io/fbx].
        As with the [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent], a clip is created for each take in the FBX file.
        The `${FBX_TAKE_NAME}` and `${FBX_TAKE_INDEX}` local variables can be used with the __Name__ parameter to generate clip names based on the take name and index from the FBX file.
    File:
	The disk path to a `.clip` or `.bclip` to use.
        As with the [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent], the `${CLIP}` local variable can be used as a `*` placeholder to load a set of files.
        The name of the clip is inferred by substituting the string matched by `${CLIP}` for `${CLIP}` in the __Name__ parameter.
    CHOP:
	The path to a CHOP to load the clip data from.

CHOP:
    Specifies the CHOP node to load the clip from.

File:
    Specifies the file to load the clip from, when __Source__ is __File__ or __FBX__.

Keep External Reference:
    #id: keepref

    When __Source__ refers to a filename on disk, this boolean flag indicates whether the external reference should be maintained when the geometry will be saved.
    If the reference is maintained, then the original source of the clip needs to be available when the saved geometry is used.
    Otherwise, a copy of the clip will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the original clip is no longer needed.

Take Name:
    Specifies which take(s) in the FBX file to import animation from.
    This supports the standard pattern matching syntax to specify multiple takes.
    If empty, all takes will be loaded.
