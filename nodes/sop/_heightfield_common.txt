Height Layer:
    #id: heightlayer
    
    The name of the height volume to operate on, usually `height`.


Mask Layer:
    #id: masklayer
    
    If a mask volume is wired into this node's second input, this specifies which volume in the second input to use to mask this node's effect, usually `mask`. Click the "Add mask paint" button to paint the mask directly in the viewport (this automatically adds a paint node to the second input).


Combine with Existing:
    #id: combine
    
    How to combine this mask with any existing mask in the input.
    
    Replace:
        Clear the existing mask and replace it with the new mask.
        
    Add:
        Add the values in this mask to any existing mask.
        
    Subtract:
        Subtract the values in this mask from any existing mask.
        
    Difference:
        Set the mask values to the difference between the old mask and this mask.

    Multiply:
        Multiply the values of the old mask by the values in this mask. This might be useful to "scale" existing values while leaving empty areas alone.

    Maximum:
        Set the mask values to the maximum of the old mask and this mask.
        
    Minimum:
        Set the mask values to the minimum of the old mask and this mask.
        
    Blend:
        Blend the old mask and this mask by a certain amount.

Blend:
    #id: blend
    
    The amount to blend the old mask with what you draw, when __Combine with existing__ is "blend". A value of `0` leaves the existing mask, a value of `1` replaces with the new mask, a value of `0.5` blends equally between the old and new mask.


Blur Method:
    #id: blurmethod
    
    How to blur the edges of the mask. The effect is only visible when __Blur radius__ is greater than 0.
    
    Blur:
        Gaussian blur.
        
    Box Blur:
        Faster blur.
        
    Expand:
        Instead of blurring, expand the drawn shapes.
        
    Shrink:
        Instead of blurring, shrink the drawn shapes.
        
    
Blur Radius:
    #id: blurradius
    
    How much to blur/expand/shrink the edges of the filled shapes (depending on the __Blur method__). A value of 0 has no effect.


Drawing Plane:
    #id: stroke_projtype
    
    The plane onto which your drawing is projected. There are basically two useful options: the plane corresponding to the orientation of the volume (ZX by default) so you can draw looking "down" at the ground, or "Geometry" so you can draw onto the visualized terrain.
    
    XY/YZ/ZX Plane:
        Project onto the given plane. Choose the plane that corresponds to your volume's orientation.
        
    Screen Plane:
        This option is copied from the underlying Stroke SOP and is not useful for height fields.
        
    Geometry:
        Finds the geometry under the mouse as you draw and maps it onto the corresponding coordinates on the ground plane.


Output Clipped Layer:
    #id: cliplayer
    
    If this is not empty, adds a mask to the output geometry named this (usually `mesa`) that marks where the height field was clipped. You can use this mask to apply effects to areas that were or weren't clipped.


Output Edge Layer:
    #id: edgelayer
    
    The node adds a mask to the output geometry named this (usually `cliffs`) that marks the voxel borders around where heights were clipped. You can use this mask to apply effects to areas around the clipping.

Random Seed:
    #id: seed

    A seed used to generate random numbers in the node. A different seed will result in slightly different noise. A newly created node will have a randomly generated seed value.
