= Adaptive Prune =

"""Removes elements while trying to maintain the overall appearance."""

This operator prunes elements (points, curves or packed primitives) based on camera distance.

When elements become more distant, they are scaled down and eventually deleted.

Remaining elements are scaled up to preserve the visual density of the collection of elements as a whole.

@parameters

== General ==

Group:
    #id: group

    The group of elements to operate on.

Element Type:
    #id: elemtype

    Points:
	    Operate on points. Points are scaled by modifying the __Point Scale__ attribute (`pscale` by default).

    Curves:
	    Operate on curves. Curves are scaled by modifying the __Width Attribute__ (`width` by default).

    Packed Primitives:
	    Operate on packed primitives. Packed primtives are scaled by modifying their intrinsic transform data.

== Pruning Criteria ==

Global Seed:
    #id: seed

    The seed value used in addition to the __Seed Attribute__ to randomize pruning per element.

Seed Attribute:
    #id: seedattrib

    The value of this attribute is used to randomize pruning per element. This is required to achieve consistent results throughout an animation when the input has changing point numbers.

Scale Attribute:
    #id: pointscaleattrib

    The scale attribute used for points.

Width Attribute:
    #id: curvewidthattrib

    The width attribute used for curves.

Camera:
    #id: cam

    The camera used for computing element distance.

Size Unit:
    #id: screensizeunit

    The unit in which the size of each elements is specified.

    Fraction Of Screen Width:
	    Specify element size as a fraction of screen width. An element that fills the entire width of the screen has a size of `1.0`.

	    Use this if you prefer your settings to be independent of the camera's resolution.

    Pixels:
	    Specify element size in pixels. Use this if you prefer the pruning to depend on camera resolution. Setting a lower resolution on the camera will cause more elements to be deleted.


Size Threshold:
    #id: screensizethresh
    The screen size at which pruning starts to occur.
    
    Specified as a fraction of screen width or size in pixels, depending on the __Size Unit__ setting.

Aggressiveness:
    #id: screenagg

    Controls how aggressively elements are pruned as they become smaller than the threshold size.

    Higher values cause elements to be pruned more rapidly as they become smaller.

== Output ==

Delete Elements:
    #id: delete

    Delete elements once they fade to a scale of `0`.

    TIP:
	    Deleting can be a slow operation when the input has a lot of elements.

	    When you prune points in preparation for use with the [Copy to Points SOP|Node:/sop/copytopoints] or another operator than can use a group of points, it is often faster to disable this and create a __Keep Group__ to use as the target group.

Scale Elements:
    #id: scale

    Scale elements to fade them out before pruning and scale up remaining elements to compensate for pruned ones.

Create Prune Group:
    #id: createprunegroup

    Create a group of pruned elements. This is only available when __Delete Elements__ is disabled.

Prune Group:
    #id: prunegroup

    The name of the group of pruned elements.

Create Keep Group:
    #id: createkeepgroup

    Create a group of kept elements.

Keep Group:
    #id: keepgroup

    The name of the group of kept elements. This is especially useful for identifying remaining elements when __Delete Elements__ is disabled.

Output Scale Factor:
    #id: outputscalefactor

    Output the factor by which elements are scaled as an attribute.

Scale Factor Attrib:
    #id: scalefactorattrib

    The name of the scale factor attribute.
