"""Computes the centroid of each piece of the geometry."""

This SOP computes the centroid of each piece of the geometry, or the geometry as a whole.
The default behavior is to create a point at the location of each centroid, but the centroid location can also be recorded as an attribute on the geometry.

This SOP can be useful for building [constraint networks|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] or converting geometry to a point-based representation.

@parameters
Run Over:
    Specifies which elements of the geometry to compute the centroid for.

    Pieces:
        Compute the centroid for each unique value of the __Piece Attribute__.
    Detail:
        Compute the centroid of the entire geometry.

Piece Attribute:
    The name of a string or integer attribute.

Piece Elements:
    Specifies whether the pieces consist of primitives or points.

Method:
    #id: method
    Specifies how the centroid is computed.

    Center of Mass:
        Computes the center of mass of the geometry in the same manner as the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].
        This method requires the geometry to contain polygons.

    Bounding Box Center:
        Computes the center of the geometry's bounding box.

Output:
    Specifies whether to create a point at the center of each piece, or to record the centroid as an attribute on the geometry.

Centroid Attribute:
    Specifies the name of the attribute to create when __Output__ is __Attribute__.

Transfer Attributes:
    Specifies a list of attributes to transfer from the __Piece Elements__ to the generated points.

Transfer Groups:
    Specifies a list of groups to transfer from the __Piece Elements__ to the generated points.
