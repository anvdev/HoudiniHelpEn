"""Creates coordinate frame attributes for points and vertices."""

This node generates coordinate frame attributes for points and vertices
based on a user selected frame-style. Computed frames consist of normal,
tangent, and bitangent vectors; however, the user may choose to disable
output of tangent and/or bitangent vectors. Computed vectors are normalized
but are not necessarily orthogonal. You can choose to make the vectors orthogonal by turning on the __Make Frame Orthogonal__ checkbox in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

The __Texture UV Gradient__ frame style requires texture coordinate attributes (either point or vertex attributes). Texture coordinates are taken from the current layer.

@parameters

Group:
    A subset of the source geometry for which attributes are to be
    computed.

Entity:
    The type of elements referenced in the __Group__ field.

Style:
    First Edge:
        For each point, the normal vector is a smoothed point normal,
        the tangent vector is in the direction of the edge on which the
        point lies (specifically, the edge appearing first in the winding
        order), and the bitangent vector is orthogonal to the normal
        and tangent vectors. The following image shows tangent (red) and
        bitangent (yellow) vectors computed for the points of a triangle.

    Two Edges:
        For each point, the normal vector is a smoothed point normal,
        the tangent vector is in the direction of the sum of the two
        edge vectors (where the edge vectors are the vector differences
        between the neighbouring points and the point for which the
        frame is being computed) on which the point lies, and the
        bitangent vector is orthogonal to the normal and tangent vectors.
        The following image shows tangent (red) and bitangent (yellow)
        vectors computed for the points of a triangle.

    Primitive Centroid:
        For each point, the normal vector is a smoothed point normal,
        the tangent vector is in the direction of the vector difference
        of the point and the primitive centroid, and the bitangent is
        orthogonal to the normal and tangent vectors.
    Texture UV:
        For each point, the normal vector is a smoothed point normal,
        the tangent vector is the direction most corresponding with
        an increase in u and no change in v, and the bitangent vector
        is the direction most corresponding with an increase in v and
        no change in u.  If __Attribute Name__ is not empty, it will
        try to read an attribute with that name for the UV attribute.
        If __Attribute Name__ is empty, it will use `uv`.
    Texture UV Gradient:
        For each vertex, the normal vector is the polygon's surface
        normal, the tangent vector is in the direction of maximum
        increase of the u texture coordinate attribute, and the
        bitangent vector is in the direction of maximum increase of
        the v texture coordinate attribute.
    Attribute Gradient:
        For each vertex, the normal vector is the polygon's surface
        normal, the tangent vector is in the direction of maximum
        increase of the first component of the specified attribute, and the
        bitangent vector is in the direction of maximum increase of
        the second component of the specified attribute.
    MikkT:
	Uses the standard MikkT approach for computing local surfaces.  This
	requires a uv attribute and a Normal attribute to already
	exist on the input.  It will also generate a signs field
	that can be used to compress the bitangent by storing
	its sign with respect to normal and tangent.

Attribute Name:
    The name of the point or vertex attribute to use when __Style__ is
    __Attribute Gradient__ or __Texture UV__.

Normal Name:
    The name of the normal attribute.

Tangent Name:
    The name of the tangent attribute.

Bitangent Name:
    The name of the bitangent attribute.

Signs Name:
    The name of the signs attribute.  Stores 1 or -1 if initialized,
    storing if the local bitangent matches the normal/tangent cross
    product or not.

Make Frame Orthogonal:
    When enabled, enforces the constraint that the frame vectors be
    orthogonal. The tangent and bitangent vectors are adjusted to be
    orthogonal to each other and the normal.

Left-Handed Frame:
    When __Make Frame Orthogonal__ is enabled, this specifies whether to
    create a left-handed (on) or right-handed (off) coordinate frame.
    Most situations require a right-handed coordinate frame, where
    the cross product of the tangent (x) and the bitangent (y) is the normal (z).
    In a left-handed coordinate frame, the cross product of the bitangent (y)
    and the tangent (x) is the normal (z), or equivalently, the cross product
    of the tangent (x) and the bitangent (y) is the negative of the normal (-z).
