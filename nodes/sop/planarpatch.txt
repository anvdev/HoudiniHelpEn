= Planar Patch =

"""Creates a planar polygonal patch."""

Creates a uniformly subdivided patch of triangles.  The patch types allow
exact specification of boundary point counts to make procedural stitching
possible.

@parameters

Build Plane:
    #id: plane

    Which of the major axes to align the generated patch to.

    This plane position will be baked into the `materialuv` attribute.
    
Edge Length:
    #id: edgelen
    
    The internal points will attempt to maintain this spacing.   Likewise,
    the boundary points will be refined to this spacing if the point count
    is not overridden.
    
Output Curves:
    #id: outputcurves
    
    Output only the boundary curves, not the internal detail.  The result
    can be sent to a __Planar Patch from Curves__ to generate the internal
    detail.
    
== Dimensions ==

Shape:
    #id: shape
    
    Rectangle:
	Right angle patch of fixed width and height.
        
    Trapezoid:
	A tapered rectangle.   Skewing is also supported.
        
    Circle:
	A solid circular patch.  The boundary is broken into
	four arcs, corresponding to a distorted square.
        
    Ring:
	An annulus, or circle-with-hole patch.  The outside and inside 
	circles form the top and bottom sides of the patch.  If an open arc is
	generated, the left and right are the seam sides.
    
Size:
    #id: size
    
    Size of the patch along the build plane.
    
Center:
    #id: t
    
    Center of the patch.  For open arcs, this is the center of the 
    circle rather than the barycenter of the generated patch.
    
Inner Size:
    #id: innerrad
    
    Absolute size of the internal circle of the patch.
    
Uniform Scale:
    #id: scale
    
    Overall uniform scaling of the patch.  While this scales the size
    and inner size, it does not scale the edge length.  To scale the
    edge length as well, append a __Transform SOP__.
    
Open Arc:
    #id: arcangle
    
    Segment of open arc to use for the patch.
    
Seam Offset:
    #id: seamoffset
    
    When splitting a circular patch into four arcs, or marking the internal
    seam of a complete ring, this controls the location of the first cut.
    
Side:
    #id: side
    
    In Trapezoid mode, controls which side is scaled and skewed.
    
Taper:
    #id: taper

    Amount to scale the tapered side of a trapezoid.  0 will contract to
    a point, and 2 will double the size.
    
Skew:
    #id: skew

    Amount to shift the tapered side away from the center, scaled by the size.
    0.5 will shift the center to match the corresponding end point on the
    opposing edge.  1.0 will shift a unit-taper so its bottom point matches the
    top of the opposing edge.
    
    
== Seams ==

Patch Name:
    #id: patchname

    Generates a `patch` primitive attribute with this name on the output,
    useful for tracking the origin of multiple patches when merged.
    
    
Left Seam:
    #id: group_left

    An ordered point group of this name will be made of all the left points.
    
Reverse:
    #id: rev_left

    Reverse the sense of the left point group.
    
    
Left Points:
    #id: resample_left
    
    Override the number of points to sample the left edge into, rather
    than based on edge length, this exact count will be used.
    
Right Seam:
    #id: group_right
    
    An ordered point group of this name will be made of all the right points.
    
Reverse:
    #id: rev_right
    
    Reverse the sense of the right point group.
    
Right Points:
    #id: resample_right
    
    Override the number of points to sample the right edge into, rather
    than based on edge length, this exact count will be used.

Top Seam:
    #id: group_top
    
    An ordered point group of this name will be made of all the top points.
    
Reverse:
    #id: rev_top
    
    Reverse the sense of the top point group.
    
Top Points:
    #id: resample_top
    
    Override the number of points to sample the top edge into, rather
    than based on edge length, this exact count will be used.
    
Bottom Seam:
    #id: group_bot
    
    An ordered point group of this name will be made of all the bottom points.
    
Reverse:
    #id: rev_bot
    
    Reverse the sense of the bottom point group.
    
Bottom Points:
    #id: resample_bot
    
    Override the number of points to sample the bottom edge into, rather
    than based on edge length, this exact count will be used.
    
Interior Points:
    #id: interiorgroup
    
    Creates a point group of all the interior points generated.
