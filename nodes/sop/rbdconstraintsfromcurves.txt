= RBD Constraints From Curves =

"""Creates rigid body constraint geometry from curves drawn in the viewport."""


== Overview == 

This node lets you draw a curve in the viewport, and will create constraints between points on the geometry of nearby pieces within a specified search radius. Alternatively, you can provide a curve as the 4th input, so that you can use this node procedurally. Once the curve is drawn, you can choose the __Connection Type__ to determine how the constraints are set up.

:task: Draw a curve:
    ((Shift + LMB)) drag.

:task: Delete the curve:
    ((Ctrl + MMB)) click the curve.
    
:task: Edit a point on the curve:
    ((MMB)) drag the point.

:task: Insert a point on the curve:
    ((Shift + MMB)) click the curve.
    
:task: Delete a point on the curve:
    ((Ctrl + LMB)) click the point.
    
:task: Edit hinge position:
    ((LMB)) drag the hinge.
    
:task: Delete hinge:
    ((Ctrl + LMB)) click the hinge.

:task: Slide hinge position along the constraint line.
    ((MMB)) drag along the line.

:task: Switch between curve and hinge tools:
    Press ((1)).

:task: Switch between edit and transform handle:
    Press ((2)).

@inputs

Geometry:
    Input geometry to create constraints for.

Constraint Geometry:
    Constraint geometry to be merged with.

Proxy Geometry:
    Proxy geometry. The constraints will be built using this geometry when available.

Curve Geometry:
    Optional input geometry which gets resampled to create constraints within the given search radius.

@parameters

Connection Type:
    Surface Points:
        Creates constraints connecting closest points from nearby pieces.
    Hinges:
        Creates 0 length 2 point prim constraints placed at the intersection of the 2 surfaces.
    Center of Mass:
        Creates constraints connecting centroids of nearby pieces.
Hinge Length:
    Specify the length of the hinge constraint.
Create Group:
    Add the created constraints to a primitive group.
Group Name:
    The name of the primitive group to create.
Show Object Link:
    When the connection type is set to __Surface Points__ or __Hinges__, displays links to the pieces' centroids to help identify them.
Clear Curves:
    Delete all drawn curves.

Clear Hinge Edits:
    Remove all hinge constraint edits.

Use Curve Geometry:
    Use second input geometry to create constraints within proximity.

Create Cluster Attribute:
    Creates an "cluster" integer point attribute corresponding to the curve index the constraint is the nearest to.

Points per Area:
    #id: pointsperarea
    When connection type is __Center of Mass__, points are first seeded on 
    the surface of all the objects. There must be enough points for close
    points to occur to detect close surfaces. This should be scaled down
    by the square of the geometry size. For example, if your geometry is 10x bigger, 
    you should have 1/100 of the points per area.

Piece Attribute:
    #id: pieceattribute
    String or Int primitive attribute name indicating piece boundaries - no 
    constraints will be created between pieces with the same attribute value.

Search Radius:
    #id: searchradius
    Specify the maximum allowed distance when searching for nearby points.

Max Search Points:
    #id: maxsearchpoints
    Specifies an upper limit on the number of nearby points that can be 
    inspected. Lower numbers will improve performance but run the risk
    that only points from the same piece will be detected rather than 
    points on nearby pieces, causing connections to be missed.

Max Connections:
    #id: maxconnections
    Specifies an upper limit on the number of pieces that each seed point
    can be connected to.

Constraints Per Piece:
    #id: constraintsperpiece
    Specify the maximum number of constraints between 2 pieces.
