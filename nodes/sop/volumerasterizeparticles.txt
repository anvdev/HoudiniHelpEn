"""Converts a point cloud into a volume."""

The Volume Rasterize particles operation takes a cloud of points and fills
a volume accordingly. If the input volume has more than one named
primitive, the named volumes will be filled with data from point attributes
that match the name of the volume. Currently only VDB vector volumes
support filling from vector point attributes.

The point attribute `pscale` is used (along with the specified __Coverage
Attribute__) to control the generated volume.

This is a highly specialized node designed for filling the volume
as fast as possible, so a lot of the controls present in [Volume Rasterize
Points|Node:sop/volumerasterizepoints] are not available.

Filtering is automatically performed to ensure small particles will always
contribute to the resulting volume.  This means that when you rasterize to a
particularly low resolution volume, things will seem to fatten.

The `volumefilterstochastic` integer primitive attribute can be used to
override how points are filtered to voxels. For fields that can't be
meaningfully averaged together, setting this attribute to a value of 1 on
that volume primitive will cause only one of the overlapping particles to
contribute to each voxel, avoiding any averaging. This parameter only
applies to fields other than coverage.

Alternatively, the stamping method for each volume can be controlled separately
by specifying rules, bypassing the need to set primitive attributes.

NOTE:
    This node does not support rasterizing into tapered volumes.

@parameters

Destination:
    Which volumes or VDBs in the first input to stamp into.

Particles:
    A group of points in the second input to rasterize.

Filter:
    The filter shape to use when splatting particles. The default Gaussian
    filter will produce smooth blobs and is useful for larger particles. When
    the particle size is smaller than the voxel size, a box filter will produce
    a similar result in less time.

Coverage Attribute:
    Name of the point attribute that stores the coverage (or influence) of each
    particle. If the coverage attribute does not exist, each particle is
    assumed to have a coverage of 1.

Coverage Scale:
    The coverage attribute will be scaled by this value.

Particle Scale:
    The `pscale` attribute will be scaled by this value. If this attribute does
    not exist, 1 will be used as the reference.

Minimum Filter Size:
    If the particle's radius is much smaller than a voxel, it can appear to pop
    from grid-location to grid-location as it moves.  This adds an additional
    blur to particles to ensure they are this fraction of a voxel.  A value of
    1 ensures the main-support for each particle is at least a voxel, 
    guaranteeing that any movement of the particle will correspond to a smooth
    change in voxel values, at the cost of less sharp boundaries.

Velocity Blur:
    Enables rasterization of velocity blur. Velocity blurred particles are
    rasterized by creating multiple point samples along the velocity path and
    distributing the coverage of the original point among these samples.

Shutter:
    The shutter time to use for velocity blur rasterization.

Shutter Offset:
    The shutter offset to use for velocity blur rasterization.

Blur Samples:
    The number of motion blur samples to use for velocity blur rasterization.
    Larger numbers of samples will produce smoother and more accurate results,
    but will take more time to compute.

Normalize by Clamped Coverage:
    Enabling this option multiplies the sampled volume by coverage, yielding a
    smooth transition between areas covered by the particles.

    NOTE:
        This option changes the default stamping method from __Weighted Average__
        to __Covered Average__; __Attribute Rules__ can be used to override this
        default behavior.

Attribute Rules:
    Rules that specify the stamping method on a per-volume basis.

    NOTE:
        If multiple rules apply to a volume, the first one is used.

    NOTE:
        `volumefilterstochastic` primitive attribute takes precedence over the
        rules. That is, __Stochastic__ stamping will be used for all volumes that
        have a value of 1 for the aforementioned attribute. If value is 0,
        however, then the appropriate rule still applies.

    NOTE:
        The __Coverage Attribute__ is unconditionally stamped using the
        __Accumulated__ method.

Attributes:
    This pattern identifies volumes to which the rule applies.

Method:
    Stamping method to use when generating the volumes to which this rule
    applies.

    Weighted Average:
        Voxel value is weighted average of attribute value from the overlapping
        particles; weight depends on the coverage attribute, as well as
        distance of the particle from the sample location.
    Covered Average:
        Same as __Weighted Average__, but areas outside of particle influence are
        attenuated, yielding smooth falloff.
    Accumulated:
        Contributions from all particles are simply summed up.
    Stochastic:
        Voxel value is deduced from a single (pseudorandomly selected)
        overlapping particle.
