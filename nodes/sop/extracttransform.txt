"""Computes the best-fit transform between two pieces of geometry."""

This SOP computes the transform (translation, rotation, and optionally scale) that best aligns the reference geometry's points with the target geometry.
If __Use Piece Attribute__ is enabled, a transform will be computed for each piece in the geometry, instead of for the geometry as a whole.
Additionally, if a piece contains a single packed primitive, the SOP will compare the primitive transforms between the inputs to allow transforms to be extracted from animated packed primitives without unpacking.

The output geometry of this SOP contains one point for each piece in the reference geometry, with [point attributes|/copy/instanceattrs] describing the transform.
These points can be used with the [Transform Pieces SOP|Node:sop/xformpieces] to apply the transform to geometry.

This extraction can be useful for setting up rigid body colliders (for which an animated rigid transform is ideal) from baked geometry files that represent rigid motion.

@parameters
    Use Piece Attribute:
        Compute a transform for the points associated with each unique value of the __Piece Attribute__.
    Piece Attribute:
        The name of a string or integer attribute.
    Attribute Class:
        Specifies whether the __Piece Attribute__ is a primitive or point attribute.
    Extraction Method:
        Specifies how to compute the best-fit transform between the reference and target geometry.

        Translation and Rotation:
            Finds the rigid transform that best aligns the points with the target geometry.
        Translation, Rotation, and Uniform Scale:
            Allows the points to be uniformly scaled, in addition to being translated and rotated.

    Compute Distortion:
        For each piece, records an attribute containing a measurement of the difference between the transformed points in the reference geometry and the target geometry's points.
        A value of 0 indicates that the extracted transform is a perfect fit.
    Distortion Attribute:
        Specifies the name of the point attribute created when __Compute Distortion__ is enabled.

@inputs
    Reference Geometry:
        The rest geometry to transform.

    Target Geometry:
        The geometry for which to compute a transform from the Reference Geometry.
