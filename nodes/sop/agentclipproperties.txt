"""Defines how agents' animation clips should be played back."""

This SOP creates geometry (which can be attached to a [crowd object|Node:dop/crowdobject#clipproperties]) describing advanced options for how animation clips should be played back by the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver].
Each point in the geometry represents an animation clip, and point attributes describe properties such as a sub-range of frames that should be looped.

        td>>
            Specifies a unique name that will be used to refer to the adjusted clip.

        td>>
            This string is matched with the agent's `agentname` point attribute to avoid potential name conflicts if a crowd contains multiple agent definitions.
            For example, two different types of agents may both have a clip named 'walk'.
    tr>>
        td>> `blend_duration_after`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies how long (in seconds) to blend out of the final pose of the loop range.
    tr>>
        td>> `blend_duration_before`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies how long (in seconds) to blend toward the initial pose of the loop range.
    tr>>
        td>> `enable_looping`
        td>> Point
        td>> Integer
        td>>
            Specifies whether clip playback should stop after reaching the end of the loop range.
    tr>>
        td>> `gait_speed`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies the gait speed used when retiming an in-place animation clip based on the agent's speed.
    tr>>
        td>> `loop_range`
        td>> Point
        td>> Vector2
        td>>
            Specifies the range of time (in seconds) that the clip should loop between.
    tr>>
        td>> `sample_rate`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Stores the clip's sample rate.
    tr>>
        td>> `start_time`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>>
            Specifies the time (in seconds) that the clip should start at.
            This value can be less than the start of the loop range to allow a pre-roll before the looped section.

@parameters

Units:
    The units for which time parameters are specified. This can be frames (at the Houdini FPS) or samples (in the clip's sample rate).

Range Type:
    Specifies whether the loop range is interpreted as an inclusive or exclusive range.
    The default behavior is to use an inclusive range to match the [Agent Clip SOP|Node:sop/agentclip].

Clips:
    The number of clips to edit properties for.

Clip Name:
    The name of one of the agent's animation clips.

Clip Name Alias:
    Specifies a new name that will be used to refer to the modified clip.
    This can be useful for creating several virtual clips from different sections of a single source animation clip.

Custom Gait Speed:
    Specifies that the [in-place gait speed|Node:dop/crowdstate#gaitspeed] should be overridden for this clip.

Gait Speed:
    Specifies how fast the agent is moving in the (in-place) animation clip.
    This is used by the crowd solver when retiming in-place animation clips based on the agent's speed.

Custom Loop Range:
    Specifies that the animation clip should loop between a particular sub-range of time.

Loop Range:
    When __Custom Loop Range__ is enabled, specifies the samples that the clip should loop between.
    If __Custom Start Frame__ is not enabled, the start frame will be set to the beginning of the loop range.

Custom Start Frame:
    Specifies that the animation clip should begin playback from the __Start Frame__ instead of the beginning of the loop range.

Start Frame:
    Specifies the initial time that playback should start from.
    This value can be less than the start of the loop range to allow a pre-roll before the looped section.

Enable Looping:
    When looping is disabled, the clip time will not advance after reaching the end of the loop range.

Blend While Looping:
    Enables blending between the initial and final poses as the clip loops around.

Frames Before:
    Specifies how long to blend toward the pose at the start of the loop range before the clip loops around.

Frames After:
    Specifies how long to blend out of the pose at the end of the loop range after the clip loops around.
