= Agent Clip =

"""Adds new clips to agent primitives."""

This adds additional animation clips to an agent primitive's definition for
driving its skeleton.

The channels within the clip should be of the form `transform_name:channel_name`
where `transform_name` is a string matching the values found by calling the
[Vex:agenttransformnames]() VEX function and `channel_name` is one of `tx`,
`ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz`, `sx`, `sy`, or `sz`. The channels starting
with `t` denote translation, `r` denote rotation, and `s` denote scale. The
resulting transforms will be treated as _local_ transforms, such as those
returned by the [Vex:agentlocaltransforms] VEX function (ie. they are relative
to the corresponding parent transform in the agent's skeleton).

@parameters

Clips:
    The number of clips to add.

Group:
    #id: group

    The points in the input geometry for agents whose definition is to be
    modified.

Name:
    #id: name

    The name to identify the clip. All clips in an agent definition must have
    unique names.

Source:
    #id: source

    The source to use for the clip to add.

    CHOP:
	The path to a CHOP to use
    File:
	The disk path to a `.clip` or `.bclip` to use.
        As with the [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent], the `${CLIP}` local variable can be used as a `*` placeholder to load a set of files.
        The name of the clip is inferred by substituting the string matched by `${CLIP}` for `${CLIP}` in the __Name__ parameter.

Keep External Reference:
    #id: keepref

    When __Source__ refers to a filename on disk, this boolean flag indicates
    whether the external reference should be maintained when the geometry will
    be saved. If the reference is maintained, then the original source of the
    clip needs to be available when the saved geometry is used. Otherwise, a
    copy of the clip will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the
    original clip is no longer needed.
