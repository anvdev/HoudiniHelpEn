"""Unpacks a Vellum simulation into two outputs."""

Vellum simulations consist of both geometry an constraints.  To make
it easier to work with, they can be packed into a single geometry
using a [Vellum Pack SOP|Node:sop/vellumpack].  The Vellum Unpack SOP undoes this operation.

If merges have combined multiple simulations, they will be properly
collated and merged in the output.  The `vellum_type` string attribute
is used to detect this, so should be preserved.

If multiple objects are unpacked, `weld` and `branchweld` attributes will be
updated to track the new point numbers. Note that `id` attributes are
not currently updated properly.

Any name attribute on the packed primitives will be copied into the
contents, allowing one to track where the unpacked geometry came from

@parameters

Transfer Attributes:
    Specifies a list of attributes to transfer to the unpacked geometry.

Transfer Groups:
    Specifies a list of groups to transfer to the unpacked geometry.

Update Rest Lengths:
    If the packed geometry was scaled, the stored rest lengths
    will be incorrect after unpacking.  This will recompute
    the rest attributes from the unpacked geometry.  This will
    erase any differences between rest & initial geometry
    that may have been intentionally created, however.
