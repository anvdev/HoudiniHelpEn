"""Extracts geometry from agent primitives."""

This SOP converts [agent primitives|/crowds/agents] into geometry, with several possible formats.
Using the [Unpack SOP|Node:sop/unpack] to unpack an agent is equivalent to setting the __Output__ parameter to __Deforming Geometry__.

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of input geometry to unpack.

Output:
    Specifies how to generate the output geometry.

    Deforming Geometry:
        Generates geometry from the shapes in the agent's [current layer|/crowds/agents#currentlayers].
        For a deforming shape binding, the shape's geometry is deformed using the agent's current pose.
        For a static shape binding, the shape is transformed by the referenced joint's transform.
        This is equivalent to unpacking the agent with the [Unpack SOP|Node:sop/unpack].

    Rest Geometry:
        Outputs the shapes from the agent's [current layer|/crowds/agents#currentlayers].
        No deformation is performed for deforming shape bindings.

    Joints:
        Creates a point for each of the agent's joints, with point attributes containing the joint's name and transform.

Shapes:
    Specifies a list or pattern of shape names to include when unpacking the agent.
    The default behaviour is to output all of the shapes from the agent's current layer.

[Include:/nodes/sop/unpack#iterations]

Transfer Attributes:
    #id: transferattributes
    Specifies a list of attributes to transfer to the unpacked geometry.
    Computed point velocities will be transferred if both "v" and "w" point
    attributes exist and are specified.

Transfer Groups:
    #id: transfergroups
    Specifies a list of groups to transfer to the unpacked geometry.

Filters:
    Specifies the joints for which points are created.
    If there aren't any filters, a point will be created for each joint.

    Joints:
        A list or pattern of joint names to create points for.

    Percent of Agents:
        Only outputs points for a percentage of agents in the crowd.
        This can be useful for controlling the placement of props.

    Seed:
        Random seed used when pruning agents for the __Percent to Keep__ parameter.
