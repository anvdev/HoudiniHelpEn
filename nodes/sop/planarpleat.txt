"""Deforms flat geometry into a pleat."""

Planar Pleat takes a flat geometry and applies a deformation to add
a pleat.  It preserves distance along the original plane, so avoids
stretching or distorting the geometry.

Note:
    Additional seams are not generated, so the geometry should already have edges along the fold lines to avoid rumpling the boundary of the pleat.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group
    
    Points to deform with the pleating operation.
    
Build Plane:
    #id: plane

    The plane used for deformation.  The pleating will be done in
    the direction orthogonal to this plane.
    
Center:
    #id: t

    The center of the first pleat fold.
    
    
Pleat Direction:
    #id: dir

    The direction of the pleat's fold line.  Measured in degrees off
    the principle axis of the build plane.
    
    
Pleat Type:
    #id: type

    What style of pleat to create.
    
    Accordion:
	An accordion pleat is V shaped ridge.
        
    Knife:
	A knife pleat is an accordion pleat, but is folded asymmetrically
	so the top can fold back along the plane.
        
    Box:
	A box pleat is a pair of opposite facing knife pleats that
	cancel each other out.
        
    
Fold Angle:
    #id: angle
    
    The angle of the first fold.   180 will fold fully back on the original
    plane.
    
Pleat Scale:
    #id: pleatscale

    The combination of inside fold, outside fold, and spacing often are
    specific to the designed pleat.  This provides a universal scale to
    apply on top of that to generate the same shaped pleat but at larger
    or smaller sizes.
    
Inside Fold:
    #id: inside

    The distance from the first fold to the second.   For accordion pleats,
    symmetry is enforced so this also controls the second distance.  Note
    this is distance along the original plane, the resulting geometry
    will be shifted as the inside fold is raised above the plane by the
    fold angle.
    
    
Outside Fold:
    #id: outside
    
    Distance from the second fold the third fold.  The third fold
    undoes whatever lift was induced by the fold angle, returning the
    geometry back to the plane and a flat direction.
    
Spacing:
    #id: spacing

    Distance between successive pleats.  For box pleats, this must be
    large enough for the top of the box pleat to have sufficient space
    to avoid self-intersection.
    
    
Pleats After:
    #id: postpleat

    Number of times to repeat the pleating operation after the center location.
    
    
Pleats Before:
    #id: prepleat
    
    Number of times to repeat the pleating operation before the center location.

    Using before, as opposed to after, can be helpful depending on which
    direction you want the unpleated geometry to be dragged to make room
    for the pleat.
