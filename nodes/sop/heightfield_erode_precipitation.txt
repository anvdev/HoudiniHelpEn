"""Distributes water along a heightfield. Offers controls for adjusting the intensity, variability, and location of rainfall."""

@parameters

== Rain ==

Amount:
    #id: rain_amount
    
    The intensity of rainfall. Higher values correspond to more rainfall. Negative values simulate evaporation.

rain_amountmaskmode:
	#id: rain_amountmaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for rain amount or not.
	
Amount Mask:
	#id: rain_amountmasklayer
	
	The name of the rain amount mask.
	
Density:
    #id: rain_density

    The fraction of voxels that will receive rainfall.

Expand Radius:
    #id: rain_expandradius

    This parameter can be used to expand the radius of each raindrop to cover more cells. This produces larger drops, which could make the incisions on the terrain more sparse and increase their width.

Blur Radius:
   #id: rain_blurradius

    This parameter can be used to blur the column of water to make a smoother transition for each drop from a water cell to a dry cell. This parameter can be used to increase the width of the incisions on the terrain, while also making them smoother.
	
Random Seed:
    #id: seed
    
    Random seed to make erosion vary for the same set of variables on the same input.
	
== Layer Bindings ==
	
Height Layer:
    #id: heightlayer
    
    A layer whose values represent height of the height field. This layer is not modified by this node.
	
Water Layer:
    #id: waterlayer
    
    A layer whose values represent water depth. This layer is modified by this node.
