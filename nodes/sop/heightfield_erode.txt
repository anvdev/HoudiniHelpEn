"""Calculates thermal and hydraulic erosion over time (frames) to create more realistic terrain."""

This node uses rainfall, the erodibility of the soil, and entrainment rates as variables to simulate erosion and deposit buildup.

This node works iteratively during playback. It will appear to have no effect on the first frame. You need to play the animation to see the effects of the node. Once the simulation converges to something that looks good, you can export the volumes from that frame to a file (using [Height Field Output|Node:sop/heightfield_output]).

For an example of erosion, create the Mountain preset from the __Terrain FX__ shelf tab and press Play.

@parameters

Reset Simulation:
    #id: resimulate
    
    Click to clear the simulation cache. Be careful clicking this if you are not viewing the first frame. Houdini will have to re-simulate every frame up to the one you are viewing, which can be slow if you are on a high frame number.

Freeze:
    #id: dofreeze
    
    Freeze the output at the specified frame. This can be used to fix the output once the number of desired frames is determined.
	
Freeze at Frame:
	#id: feezeframe
	
	The number of frames to feeze the output at.

== Main ==
    
Global Erosion Rate:
    #id: globalerosionrate
    
    Controls how many meters of bedrock or debris (here entrained material) is eroded every iteration.

These options control erosion from rainfall, where the flow of water downhill weathers the terrain. You can control the amount of rainfall using the controls on the __Precipitation__ tab and the water flow using the controls on the __Flow__ tab.

~~~ Hydro ~~~
    
Erodability:
    #id: erodability
    
    Controls the softness of bedrock or debris (here entrained material). Higher values would make the terrain easier to erode, causing deeper incisions, more sediment, and more debris being deposited as a result.

erodabilitymaskmode:
	#id: erodabilitymaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for erodability or not.
	
Erodability Mask:
	#id: erodabilitymasklayer
	
	The name of the erodability mask.
	
Erosion Rate:
    #id: erosionrate
    
    Controls the rate at which erosion happens. This is a multiplier on `Erodability`.
	
Bank Angle:
    #id: bankangle
    
    Sets the angle at which the riverbank rests relative to the riverbed. Lowre values would make wider and flatter river channels.

bankanglemaskmode:
	#id: bankanglemaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for bank angle or not.
	
Bank Angle Mask:
	#id: bankanglemasklayer
	
	The name of the bank angle mask.

Spread Iterations:
    #id: water_spreaditers
    
    The number of iterations of water spreading simulation to do. More iterations result in longer and less dense incisions.
	
~~~ Thermal ~~~

Thermal weathering is caused by frozen rocks thawing and breaking, causing features to wear down and smooth out, and material to pile up on the bottom of inclines.

Erodability:
    #id: erodability
    
    Controls the softness of the eroding layer or material layer. Higher values would make the terrain easier to erode, causing deeper incisions, more sediment, and more debris being deposited as a result.

erodabilitymaskmode:
	#id: erodabilitymaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for erodability or not.
	
Erodability Mask:
	#id: erodabilitymasklayer
	
	The name of the erodability mask.
	
Erosion Rate:
    #id: erosionrate
    
    Controls the rate at which erosion happens. This is a multiplier on `Erodability`.

Cut Angle:
    #id: cutangle
    
    Set the angle at which the thermal erosion would stop cutting beyond. A lower angle would make the cuts flatter and allow for more erosion to take place.

cutanglemaskmode:
    #id: cutanglemaskmode
	
    Controls whether to use a mask for cut angle or not.
	
Cut Angle Mask:
    #id: cutanglemasklayer
	
    The name of the cut angle mask.

Global Seed:
    #id: seed 
	
    Random seed to make erosion vary for the same set of variables on the same input.

== Advanced ==

~~~ Hydro Erosion ~~~

Removal Rate:
    #id: hydro_removalrate
    
    Proportion of debris from thermal erosion that is deleted. This simulates wind carrying away a certain amount of debris rather than it all accumulating. The default is `0` (no deletion). Negative values correspond to the debris being less dense than the rock, so one unit of eroded rock produces more than one unit of debris.

Max Debris Depth:
    #id: hydro_maxdebrisdepth
    
    Stop erosion when the debris layer reaches this depth.

Grid Bias:
	#id: hydro_gridbias
	
	Controls how biased the movement of material is. Setting it to positive values would bias the movement in the direction of the principal axes, and when set to negative values, it would bias the movement at angles of 45 degree relative to the principal axes. The default value of zero would mean no bias in any direction.

gridbiasmaskmode:
	#id: hydro_gridbiasmaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for grid bias or not.
	
Grid Bias Mask:
	#id: hydro_gridbiasmasklayer
	
	The name of the grid bias mask.

~~~~ Erodability ~~~~

Ramp-up Iterations:
	#id: hydro_erodability_rampupiters
	
	The iteration where erodability would get to its maximum value.
	
Initial Factor:
	#id: hydro_erodability_initialfactor
	
	Controls how much of the set erodability would the material have on its initial movement. It would increase over the set spread iterations until the max iteration, where it would stay at maximum set value.
	
Slope Factor:
	#id: hydro_erodability_slopefactor
	
	Control how much the slope of the terrain would affect the erosion amount. Higher values would increase the slope effecting the erosion, and lower values would decrease it. Lowing this value would increase erodability as a result.

~~~~ Riverbed ~~~~

Erosion Rate Factor:
	#id: hydro_bed_erosionratefactor
	
	A multiplier on `Erosion Rate` that would cause a change on the riverbed only. Increasing this value would cause a more aggresive erosion on the bed, and as a result, it would increase the depth of the incisions.

Deposition Rate:
    #id: hydro_bed_depositionrate
    
    Controls the rate at which the excess sediment turns into debris. A value of zero means no sediment is turned into debris, while a value of one will convert all created sediment into debris, and the bedrock would in turn be protected more by the created debris.

depositionratemaskmode:
	#id: hydro_bed_depositionratemaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for deposition rate or not.
	
Deposition Rate Mask:
	#id: hydro_bed_depositionratemasklayer
	
	The name of the deposition rate mask.

Sediment Capacity:
    #id: hydro_bed_sedimentcap
    
    The amount of sediment that can be carried per unit of moving water. The higher the capacity, the longer the material can erode before it starts depositing its excess sediment.

~~~~ Riverbank ~~~~	

Erosion Rate Factor:
	#id: hydro_bank_erosionratefactor
	
	A multiplier on `Erosion Rate` that would cause a change on the riverbank only. Increasing this value would cause a more aggresive erosion on the bank, and as a result, it would increase the width of the incisions.
	
Max Bed to Bank Water Ratio:
	#id: hydro_bank_maxbankbedwaterratio
	
	The maximum of bank to bed water column height ratio that will be considered as river bank bank. Ratios higher than this number will not be considered as bank during erosion.

~~~ Thermal Erosion ~~~

Removal Rate:
    #id: thermal_removalrate
    
    Proportion of debris from thermal erosion that is deleted. This simulates wind carrying away a certain amount of debris rather than it all accumulating. The default is `0` (no deletion). Negative values correspond to the debris being less dense than the rock, so one unit of eroded rock produces more than one unit of debris.

Max Debris Depth:
    #id: thermal_maxdebrisdepth
    
    Stop erosion when the debris layer reaches this depth.

Grid Bias:
	#id: thermal_gridbias
	
	Controls how biased the movement of material is. Setting it to positive values would bias the movement in the direction of the principal axes, and when set to negative values, it would bias the movement at angles of 45 degree relative to the principal axes. The default value of zero would mean no bias in any direction.

gridbiasmaskmode:
	#id: thermal_gridbiasmaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for grid bias or not.
	
Grid Bias Mask:
	#id: thermal_gridbiasmasklayer
	
	The name of the grid bias mask.
	
~~~ Precipitation ~~~

Mask:
    #id: maskpreciplayer
    
    The name of a mask layer controlling rainfall. The values in the layer are a scale on the __Amount__ parameter.  This is read from the second input.

Amount:
    #id: rain_amount
    
    The amount of rainfall simulated in each frame. If you use very large amounts you will not see much erosion since essentially the entire terrain would be under water.

Density:
    #id: rain_density
    
    How closely packed rain drops are. Smaller densities give more erosion lines. Larger densities create erosion cracks that are father apart and wider.

Evaporation Rate:
    #id: rain_evaporation
    
    The rate of evaporation. A higher rate will leave less pooled water in each frame. If you want more water to pool you can increase __Amount__ and/or decrease the evaporation rate.

~~~~ Raindrop Settings ~~~~

These settings can be used to control the size of raindrops. As you expand the radius of each raindrop you will have fewer drops to ensure the density of precipitation will stay constant.

Expand Radius:
    #id: rain_expandradius

    This parameter can be used to expand the radius of each raindrop to cover more cells. This produces larger drops, which could make the incisions on the terrain more sparse and increase their width.

Blur Radius:
   #id: rain_blurradius

    This parameter can be used to blur the column of water to make a smoother transition for each drop from a water cell to a dry cell. This parameter can be used to increase the width of the incisions on the terrain, while also making them smoother.

~~~ Water Flow ~~~

Quantization:
    #id: water_quant

	Controls the chunkiness of the water flow. A lower value would make the flow more continuous and a higher value would make the flow more chunky.
	
Post Smooth:
	#id: water_postsmooth
	
	Smooth the water on the terrain as a post processing step.

~~~ Debris Flow ~~~

Spread Iterations:
    #id: debris_iterations
    
    How many iterations of the spread algorithm to run for each frame.

Quantization:
    #id: debris_quant

    Controls the chunkiness of the debris flow. A lower value would make the flow more continuous and a higher value would make the flow more chunky.
	
Post Smooth:
	#id: debris_postsmooth
	
	Smooth the debris on the terrain as a post processing step.
	
Water Absorption:
    #id: water_absor

   Controls the movement of the debris based on last frame's flow field. Higher values would stop the debris from moving near the flow channels, and lower values would cause the debris to ignore the flow channels, making it move independently. 

Max Height:
    #id: debris_maxheight
    
    The maximum height of wet debris that would not move due to water absorption. Beyond this limit the debris start to move again.

Repose Angle:
    #id: debris_repose
    
    The maximum slope (measured in degrees from the horizontal) at which loose solid material will remain in place without sliding.

reposeanglemaskmode:
	#id: debris_reposeanglemaskmode
	
	Controls whether to use a mask for repose angle or not.
	
Repose Angle Mask:
	#id: debris_reposeanglemasklayer
	
	The name of the repose angle mask.
	
== Bedrock ==

Bedrock Override:
    Each frame of simulation the bedrock layer will be replaced with
    this layer in the second input.  If not present, no replacement is
    done.

Adjust Height by Bedrock Change:
    When the bedrock is changed, also adjust the terrain height.  This
    allows for mountain building where the second input has an animated
    mountain growing, the net new height is added each frame while
    erosion occurs.

~~~ Strata ~~~

Adjust Erodability by Strata:
    Adjusts how erodable rock is by how far it is away from the reference
    bedrock layer.

Strata Depth:
    The depth for the strata.  The Strata Erodability ramp uses this depth
    to control how deep it represents.   A positive values means the strata
    represents hardness below the bedrock layer.  Negative values mean
    the strata represents hardness above the bedrock layer.

Clamp at Strata Bounds:
    Depths outside of the strata range will be clamped to the ends of the
    ramp.  If clamping is off, they will repeat forming a periodic pattern.

Strata Erodability:
    How erodable rocks are at different strata depths.  The left most
    is at the bedrock reference layer, the right most at the extreme
    strata depth.  Values of 1 are fully erodable, such as loose dirt,
    and values of 0 prevent erosion, like granite.

== Layers ==

The options on this tab control what the node does if the input contains layers this node normally generates from scratch.

Remove Debris Layer from Input Height Layer:
    #id: debris_removefromheight
    
    If the input already has a debris layer (for example from a previous erode node, or painted manually), keep it as debris but ignore it in this node's erosion calculations.
    
Remove Water Layer from Input Height Layer:
    #id: water_removefromheight
    
    If the input already has a water layer (for example from a previous erode node, or painted manually), keep it as water but ignore it in this node's erosion calculations.
    
Reset Water Layer:
    #id: clearwater
    
    If the input already has a water layer, delete it.
    
Reset Debris Layer:
    #id: cleardebris
    
    If the input already has a debris layer, delete it.

Reset Sediment Layer:
    #id: clearsediment
    
    If the input already has a sediment layer, delete it.
    
Add Debris Layer to Final Height Layer:
    #id: debris_addtoheight
    
    Use the values in the debris layer to add to the height layer. You might turn this off, for example, if you plan to represent the debris layer some other way, such as a separately shaded volume, or instanced rock geometry.

Add Water Layer to Final Height Layer:
    #id: water_addtoheight
    
    Use the values in the water elevation layer to add to the height layer. The default is off. This will "bake" the water level into the height values, so for example pooled water will become flat terrain. This might be useful if you just want a very simple output where you will just color the "water" areas with a flat color.


== Bindings ==

The controls on this tab let you change the default names of the layers the node looks for/creates.

[Include:_heightfield_common#heightlayer]
    
Water Layer:
    #id: waterlayer
    
    The name of the layer containing the water elevation (default `water`).

Material Layer:
    #id: materiallayer
    
    The name of the layer containing the debris elevation (default `debris`).

Sediment Layer:
    #id: sedimentlayer
    
    The name of the layer containing the sediment elevation (default `sediment`).
	
Bedrock Layer:
    #id: bedrocklayer

    The reference layer for determining how far the current height
    has eroded.  If not present on the input, is set to the original
    height of the terrain.
    
Flow Layer:
    #id: flowlayer
    
    The node outputs a `flow` layer representing the _cumulative_ water flow. This layer has two signed components (x and y) representing the flow direction in voxel space. Because this is cumulative, if water flows left, then flows right, those two motions will cancel and the x component would be 0.

Flow Dir Layer:
    #id: flowdirlayer
    
    The node outputs a `flowdir` layer containing vectors showing the average direction of flow at each voxel.


== Simulation ==
  
Start Frame:
    #id: startframe
    
    The node does not start simulation erosion until this frame. The default is `1` (the first frame).

Cache Simulation:
    #id: cacheenabled
    
    Caches completed simulation frames in memory, for interactive scrubbing. For very large erosions, turning this option off is the best way to save memory.
    
Allow Caching To Disk:
    #id: cachetodisk
    
    When __Cache simulation__ is on and this option is on, the simulation will start caching frames to disk when it reaches the __Cache memory__ limit. Frames on disk will be slower to load than frames in memory, but still faster than re-simulating. When this option is off and the simulation reaches the limit, it simply starts deleting the oldest frames from the cache.

Cache Memory (MB):
    #id: cachemaxsize
    
    The maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) to use to cache simulated frames.


== Visualization ==

This tab contains options for visualizing the height and other layers. These are the same options as on the [Height Field Visualize|Node:sop/heightfield_visualize] node.

Visualize:
    #id: dovisualize
    
    Applies a visualization material so you can see an elevation color ramp on the height field and see the water and debris layers as different colors.

[Include:heightfield_visualize#vis_computerange]

[Include:heightfield_visualize#vis_minelevation]

[Include:heightfield_visualize#vis_maxelevation]
