= HeightField Draw Mask =

#type:     node
#context:  sop
#internal: heightfield_drawmask
#icon:     SOP/heightfield_drawmask

"""Lets you draw shapes to create a mask for height field tools."""

# Use the tab menu in the viewport to choose Height Field DrawMask

    ~~~ or ~~~

    Add a Height Field DrawMask in the network editor, select it, and in the viewer click the [Icon:TOOLS_handles] Handles tool or press ((Enter)).

# Draw on the terrain to enclose filled areas in the mask.

    * For complex geometry, you might need to draw slowly to capture detailed shapes. If you draw faster than the computer can keep up, it will drop points and you will get "low resolution" shapes.
    
    * You can draw multiple shapes in the same node.

== Masking ==

[Include:_heightfield_common#combine]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#blend]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#stroke_projtype]
