= Falloff =

"""Adds smooth distance attributes to geometry."""

Falloff generates attributes for the distance between points and the input group
of points on the input surface geometry, similar to the falloff visualizer of
[Soft Transform|Node:sop/softxform]. Distance can be measured with a variety of
metrics to produce different results, and a falloff can be applied to smooth the
attribute.


@parameters
Group:
    #id: group

    Subset of points to measure distance from.

Type:
    #id: outputtype

    The format for the __Distance Attribute__.

    Distance:
        Distance is output between 0 and __Radius__, with points outside the
        __Radius__ having the same value as a point on the boundary of the
        radius.
    Normalized Distance:
        Distance is output between 0 and 1, with points outside the __ Radius__
        having the same value as a point on the boundary of the radius.
    Unbounded Distance:
        Distance is measured over the entire model. This cannot be reversed
        since there is no maximum distance.

Distance Metric:
    #id: distmetric

    Method for measuring which points are within the radius.

    Edge Distance:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
        edges.
    Radius:
        The 3D distance to the closest point in the group.
    Surface Distance:
        The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
        the surface of the input geometry, both along edges and across polygons.

Radius:
    #id: rad
    #channels: /radius

    Maximum distance to search for points.

Reverse:
    #id: reverse

    Apply the ramp from right to left instead of left to right.

Ramp Presets:
    #id: ramppreset

    A selection of useful ramp presets which change the __Ramp__ value. When
    changes are made to a preset, the changes are saved in the Custom preset.

Ramp:
    #id: ramp

    The ramp used to smooth the __Distance Attribute__. The left side of the
    ramp is applied to points closer to the source group, unless __Reverse__ is
    toggled on.

Mix Method:
    #id: mix
    The method used to combine new values with preexisting values of the
    __Distance Attribute__.

    Maximum:
        The maximum of the new and old values is kept.
    Minimum:
        The minimum of the new and old values is kept.
    None:
        The new values are kept within the __Radius__ and the old values are
        kept outside the __Radius__. Note that this can cause very sharp changes
        in the __Distance Attribute__.
    Overwrite:
        All preexisting values are ignored.

Distance Attribute:
    #id: distattr

    If given, a point attribute with the specified name will be created,
    indicating the distance from the input group at each point. If __Output
    Type__ is __Normalized Distance__ the value will be between 0 and 1, with
    lower values being farther from the input group. Otherwise the value will be
    the measured distance from the input group.
    
Lead Point Attribute:
    #id: leadptattr

    If given, a point attribute with the specified name will be created,
    indicating the closest point in the input group at each point.

Affected Group:
    #id: falloffgroup

    If given, a point group with the specified name will be created, indicating
    which points are within __Radius__ of the input group.

NOTE: 
    When using the edge or surface __Distance Metric__ with the unbounded raw
    distance __Output Type__, points that are disconnected from geometry
    containing the source group will have a __Distance Attribute__ value of `-1`.
