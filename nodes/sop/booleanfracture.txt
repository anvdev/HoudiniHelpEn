= Boolean Fracture =

"""Fractures the input geometry using cutting surfaces."""

This SOP fractures the input mesh using one or more cutting surfaces.
Similar to [Voronoi Fracture|Node:sop/voronoifracture], this is a higher-level node (based on the [Boolean SOP|Node:sop/boolean]) that handles common fracturing-related tasks such as naming pieces, recomputing normals, and building constraints between adjacent pieces.

@inputs

Geometry to Fracture:
    The polygonal geometry that will be fractured.

Cutting Surface:
    The polygonal cutting surfaces to fracture the geometry with.

@outputs

Fractured Geometry:
    The fractured polygonal geometry.

Constraint Geometry:
    Geometry containing a point for each piece, and polygon lines connecting pieces that are adjacent. This is useful for creating a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork].

@parameters

Group:
    The geometry to be fractured.
    If no group is specified, the full input geometry will be fractured.

=== Output Attributes ===

Attribute Name Prefix:
    #id: attribnameprefix
    Specifies a prefix for the attribute or group names specified by the __Primitive Piece__, __Interior Group__, and __Exterior Group__ parameters.
    This can make it easier to create unique attribute names when performing multiple levels of fracturing.

Copy Cutting Surface Attributes:
    Copy attributes from the input cutting surface to the output piece's interior geometry.

Point Attributes:
    The point attributes to copy from the cutting surface to the points of the output piece's interior geometry.

Primitive Attributes:
    The primitive attributes to copy from the cutting surface to the primitives of the output piece's interior geometry.
