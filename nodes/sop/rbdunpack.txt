= RBD Unpack =

"""Unpacks an RBD setup into three outputs."""

RBD setups can be packed into a single geometry using an [RBD Pack SOP|Node:sop/rbdpack].
The RBD Unpack SOP undoes this operation.

If merges have combined multiple simulations, they will be properly collated and merged in the output.
The `rbd_type` string attribute is used to detect this, so should be preserved.
The `rbd_name` string attribute on the packed primitives will be copied into the contents, allowing one to track where the unpacked geometry came from.
