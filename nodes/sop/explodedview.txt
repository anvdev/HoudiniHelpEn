"""Pushes geometry out from the center to create an exploded view."""

This operation pushes selected geometry out from the center.  It does so
piece-by-piece to create an exploded view of the geometry.  This can be
very useful in visualizing how fractured geometry was broken up.

@parameters

Group:
    The geometry to push outwards.

Piece Attribute:
    The name of a string or integer attribute.
    Elements with the same value of this attribute are treated as a piece.
    If the attribute does not exist, it will be computed based on connectivity.

Piece Elements:
    Specifies whether the pieces consist of primitives or points.

Uniform Scale:
    The amount to expand the pieces.
    Each piece is moved proportionally to its distance to the center.
    A value of 1 will approximately double the size of the object.
    To undo an outwards scale of 1, an inwards scale of -0.5 can be used.

Scale:
    Non-uniform scaling along the XYZ axes.
    This is multiplied with the __Uniform Scale__ to determine the direction and distance the pieces are moved by.

Override Center:
    The center to push pieces out from is normally computed as the center of the bounding box of the input.
    This parameter lets you override that choice.
