= HeightField Mask by Feature =

#type:     node
#context:  sop
#internal: heightfield_maskbyfeature
#icon:     SOP/heightfield_maskbyfeature

"""Creates a mask based on different features of the height layer."""

This node is useful for isolating peaks and valleys, areas where snow should be placed, and areas where vegetation can grow.

The node has several different criteria you can use to create a mask. When more than one criterion is on, the final mask is the _intersection_ of the different feature masks.

WARNING:
    If you don't turn on any criteria, the node will flood fill the mask to 1.


@parameters

== Parameters ==

Smooth Radius:
    #id: smooth_radius
    
    Amount (in voxels) to blur the output mask.

[Include:_heightfield_common#combine]
    
[Include:_heightfield_common#blend]

    
=== Slope ===

Mask by Slope:
    #id: maskbyslope
    
    Generate a mask based on the slope of the terrain.
    
Min Slope Angle: Minimum slope angle.
    #id: min_slopeangle
    
    Add areas with slope greater than or equal to this value to the mask.
    
Max Slope Angle: Maximum slope angle.
    #id: max_slopeangle
    
    Add areas with slope less than or equal to this value to the mask.
    
Slope Ramp:
    #id: sloperamp
    
    Controls the value of the mask over the range from the minimum to the maximum slope. This lets you control the feathering of the mask.


=== Height ===

Mask by Height:
    #id: maskbyheight
    
    Generate a mask based on the height of the terrain.
    
Compute Range:
    #id: computerange
    
    Click to set the minimum and maximum parameters to the current minimum and maximum in the input height field.

Min Height:
    #id: minheight
    
    Add areas at this height or higher to the mask.
    
Max Height:  Maximum Height for Height mask to be applied.
	#id: maxheight
    
    Add areas at this height or lower to the mask.
    
    
Height Ramp:
    #id: heightramp
    
    Controls the value of the mask over the range from the minimum to the maximum slope. This lets you control the feathering of the mask.


=== Peaks and Valleys ===

Mask by Curvature: If selected mask is created based on the minimum and maximum curvature values.
    #id: maskbycurvature
    
    
Compute Range:
    #id: computercurvature
    
    Click to set __Max curvature__ to the current maximum curvature in the input height field.
    
    
Max Curvature:
    #id: max_curvature
    
    Add areas with curvature greater than this value to the mask.
    
    
Curvature Ramp: 
    #id: curvatureramp
    
    Controls the value of the mask over the range from 0 to the maximum curvature. This lets you control the feathering of the mask.


=== Direction ===

Mask by Direction:
    #id: maskbydir
    
    Create a mask based on the "horizontal" direction the terrain surface faces at a given point.

Goal Angle: Goal angle for the mask.
    #id: goal_angle
    
    Add areas to the mask which face this direction. The value is in degrees, plus or minus __Angle spread__. A value of 0 degrees means facing in the -X direction, +90 degrees means facing in the -Z direction.

Angle Spread:
    #id: angle_spread
    
    Amount of variance allowed around the __Goal angle__.
    
Direction Ramp: Opacity of the mask within the goal angle and variance.
    #id: dirramp
    
    Controls the value of the mask across the __Angle spread__. This lets you control the feathering of the mask.

TIP:
    To create a mask by casting light from a certain direction, see [Heightfield Mask by Shadow|Node:sop/heightfield_maskbyshadow].
