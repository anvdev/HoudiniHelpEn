= Time Blend =

"""Blends intraframe values for geometry."""

The Time Blend SOP will cook its input at both the start and end of the
closest integer frame. The values are then blended according to the
fractional position within the frame.

Optionally, one can also specify that before a start or after an end
frame, the first or last geometry should be held.

The Time Blend SOP can be used to change networks that only exist on
whole frame steps into a network with proper intermediate results. This
will only work if the topology of the geometry stays the same from frame
to frame. It then allows for effects like multi-segment motion blur to
correctly infer in between values. One such use is to turn a file sop
that reads `foo$F.bgeo` into one that is defined smoothly over time.

@parameters
Hold First Frame:
    Determines if the first frame should be clamped. If so, any
    evaluations before this frame value will instead evaluate at
    this frame value.

Hold Last Frame:
    Determines if the last frame should be clamped. If so, any
    evaluations after this frame value will instead evaluate at this
    frame value.

Attributes:
    #id: attribs

    Float attributes matching this pattern will be blended.

Point ID Attribute:
    #id: ptidattr

    If this integer or string attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding points
    in the different blend inputs. For example, using id will allow
    particle systems to find matching points even if particles are deleted.
    If it does not exist or is blank, point numbers will be used for the
    matching.

Primitive ID Attribute:
    #id: primidattr

    If this integer or string attribute exists, it will be used to find corresponding
    primitives in the different blend inputs. For example, using name
    will allow fluid systems to find matching volumes even if volumes
    are reordered.  If it does not exist or is blank, primitive numbers
    will be used for the matching.

Voxel Blend:
    #id: voxelblend

    When __By Grid Index__ is selected, matching volumes will blend their data. This is not done by spatial
    position, but by absolute voxel index.

Smoothly Interpolate Normals, Quaternions, and Transforms:
    #id: doslerp

    Enables use of spherical linear interpolation to blend attributes marked
    as normals, quaternions, and transforms, as well as any primitive transforms.
    If turned off, these types will be blended linearly.

Use Velocity When Interpolating Position:
    #id: usevforpinterp

    When enabled, the P (position) attribute will be cubically interpolated
    using the v (velocity) point attribute, and v will be quadratically interpolated using P.
    You need to set the __Time Step__ parameter to control the contribution of v.
