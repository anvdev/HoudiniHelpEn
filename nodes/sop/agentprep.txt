@parameters

=== Agent ===

Rest Clip:
    The name of the clip where the agent is "resting", meaning that the agent is static and oriented along the positive z-axis.
    This is used for [look ats|Node:sop/agentlookat].

Upper Limbs:
    Specifies the number of upper limbs (e.g. arms) in the rig.
    The upper limbs are not currently used by the crowd solver.

    Upper Arm:
        The upper arm transform.

    Lower Arm:
        The lower arm transform.

    Hand:
        The hand transform.

Torso:
    Specifies the number of torsos in the rig.

    Hips:
        The hips transform.
        This is used for hip adjustment when applying [terrain adaptation|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation].

    Lower Back:
        The lower back transform.
        This is used when leaning is enabled for [terrain adaptation|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation].

    Head:
        The head transform.
        This joint is rotated when applying [look ats|Node:sop/agentlookat] to the agent.

Lower Limbs:
    Specifies the number of lower limbs (e.g. legs) in the rig.
    The lower limbs are used for [terrain adaptation|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation].

    Upper Leg:
        The upper leg transform.

    Knee:
        The knee transform.

    Ankle:
        The ankle transform.

    Toe:
        The toe transform.

    Ankle Plant Channel:
        Name of a channel in the agent's clip catalog that indicates when the ankle should be planted.
        This is used when foot locking is enabled in the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver].

    Toe Plant Channel:
        Name of a channel in the agent's clip catalog that indicates when the toe should be planted.
        This is used when foot locking is enabled in the [crowd solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver].

    Ankle Offset:
        Offset from the ankle joint (in local space) to use when adjusting the leg for terrain adaptation.
        This can be used to ensure that the ankle's position on the skin geometry is planted on the terrain, instead of the ankle joint's position.

    Toe Offset:
        Offset from the toe joint (in local space) to use when adjusting the foot for terrain adaptation.
        This can be used to ensure that the toe's position on the skin geometry is planted on the terrain, instead of the toe joint's position.

=== Additional Channels ===

Provides options to add additional channels to the agent's animation clips, such as those used for the __Ankle Plant Channel__ and __Toe Plant Channel__.
This is an alternative to using the __Additional Channels__ parameter on the [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent] and [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent], and allows channels to be added after the clip (and agent primitive) has been created.

Modified Clips:
    Specifies the path to CHOP nodes which contain modified animation clips (such as extra channels describing when the feet are planted during the clip).
    The name of the clip is inferred from the string matched by `${CLIP}`.

Create Foot Plant CHOP Network:
    Creates a CHOP network which, for each of the agent's animation clips, uses the [Foot Plant CHOP|Node:chop/footplant] to create the __Ankle Plant Channel__ and __Toe Plant Channel__ for each of the agent's __Lower Limbs__.

Load Clips:
    Toggles whether the __Modified Clips__ are added to the agent's definition.

Source:
    Specifies whether to load the __Modified Clips__ from the specified CHOP nodes, or to use the __Clip Paths__ on disk.

Keep External References:
    When loading clips from disk, this parameter indicates whether the external
    reference should be maintained when the geometry will be saved. If the
    reference is maintained, then the original source of the clip needs to be
    available when the saved geometry is used. Otherwise, a copy of the clip
    will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the original clip is
    no longer needed.

Reload Clips:
    Reloads the __Modified Clips__.

Agent Name:
    Base name of the agent.

Cache Directory:
    The parent directory of agent definition files.

Clip Paths:
    Filename pattern of cached clip files.
    The `${CLIP}` local variable contains the name of the current clip being processed from the list of __Modified Clips__.
    As with the [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent], `${AGENT}` and `${CACHEDIR}` can be used as a convenience to reference the __Agent Name__ and __Cache Directory__ parameters.

Cache Modified Clips to Disk:
    Saves the __Modified Clips__ to disk using the paths specified by the __Clip Paths__ parameter.

@inputs

Agents:
    The agent primitives.

@outputs

Agents:
    The modified agent primitives.
