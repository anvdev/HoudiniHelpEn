= Pose-Space Edit Configure =

"""Creates common attributes used by the Pose-Space Edit SOP."""

This SOP adds the required attributes to the Rest Geometry input for the
[Pose-Space Edit SOP|Node:sop/posespaceedit]. It should only be done once.

@parameters

Shape Diff Method:
    Pre-Deform:
        Transforms the example geometry into the rest-pose by applying inverse skinning method to the example geometry before computing the difference.

    Post-Deform: 
        Computes the difference of specified attribute on the two geometries.

    Post-Deform Orient:
        Produces a similar result as the __Pre-Deform__ method however instead of transforming the example geometry with inverse skinning this method transforms each point by the inverse of the orientation indicated by a quaternion point attribute.

[Include:shapediff#orientattrib]

Use Bone Deform:
    This is implied when the `Shape Diff Method` is set to `Pre-Deform`. Otherwise, it specifies whether the [Node:sop/posespaceedit] should use [Node:sop/bonedeform] when computing the shape diff.

[Include:shapediff#skelrootpath]

Bone Deform Method:
    The skinning method used to inverse transform the deformed geometry when using __Pre-Deform__ differencing or __Use_Bone_Deform__ is enabled. The skinning method should match that used by the upstream [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/bonedeform] that deforms the geometry.

Blend Attribute:
    The name of the point attribute to use with the __Blend Dual Quaternion and Linear__ skinning method.
