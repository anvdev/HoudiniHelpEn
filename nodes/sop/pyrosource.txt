""" Creates points for sourcing pyro and smoke simulations. """

The Pyro Source SOP converts its input geometry into points suitable for
sourcing pyro and smoke simulations. This SOP adds specified attributes to the
generated points, which can be rasterized and imported into desired DOP fields
by the [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node. Pyro Source also contains a
handful of initialization presets for driving common simulation scenarios.

@inputs

Geometry to Source From:
    Input geometry. When __Mode__ is set to __Surface Scatter__ or __Volume
    Scatter__, the geometry must correspond to a surface; in the latter case,
    the surface must also have a resolvable interior.

Rest Geometry:
    If provided, this geometry will be used to generate points. These points
    are then moved to conform with the current configuration of the deforming
    geometry.

@outputs

Particles:
    Generated points, with the assigned attributes.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group
    When specified, only the subset of the input geometry corresponding to this
    group is used.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype
    What the __Group__ is made of.

Initialize:
    #id: initialize
    Configures the node according to the selected preset. __Source Fuel__ can be
    used to drive pyro simulations, whereas __Source Smoke__ is meant for smoke
    simulations. __Source Color__ creates color (`Cd`) and color density
    (`Alpha`) attributes that can be imported by the
    [Volume Source|Node:dop/volumesource] node using the `Blend` operation.

Mode:
    #id: mode
    Controls which points are exported by the node.

    Surface Scatter:
        Points are scattered on the surface of the input geometry.
    Keep Input:
        Points of the incoming geometry are used unchanged.
    Volume Scatter:
        Points are scattered in the interior of the input geometry.

Particle Separation:
    #id: particlesep
    When __Mode__ is set to __Surface Scatter__ or __Volume Scatter__, this
    parameter controls the density of seeded points; in __Keep Input__ mode,
    value of __Particle Separation__ is only used to calculate the `pscale`
    point attribute.

Particle Scale:
    #id: particlescale
    Controls the scale of exported points. The `pscale` attribute is set to the
    product of __Particle Separation__ and __Particle Scale__.

    NOTE:
        If the input already contains a `pscale` attribute, the values will not
        be changed by this node.

Deform Radius:
    #id: radius
    Physical size of the neighborhood used for deforming the scattered points.
    Only available when a rest geometry is provided and __Mode__ is set to
    `Volume Scatter`.

Minimum Points:
    #id: minpt
    If fewer than this number of points are found in the neighborhood for the
    purpose of deforming points, the search radius is increased. Only available
    when a rest geometry is provided and __Mode__ is set to `Volume Scatter`.

Maximum Points:
    #id: maxpt
    An upper bound on the neighborhood size used for deforming points. Only
    available when a rest geometry is provided and __Mode__ is set to `Volume
    Scatter`.

Attributes:
    #id: attributes
    Count of numerical attributes to create for the exported points.

Attribute:
    #id: attribute#
    The attribute to add to source points. The attribute can be selected from
    the list of commonly-used options or a custom one can be created.

Vector Attribute:
    #id: isvector#
    This option can be turned on in __Custom__ __Attribute__ mode to create a
    vector-valued attribute; if disabled, a scalar attribute is added.

Name:
    #id: name#
    Name of the created attribute.

Default Value:
    #id: fval# vval# cval#
    This value is used to initialize newly-created attributes. This parameter
    is not used for already-present point attributes.

Scale:
    #id: scale#
    The final exported value of the attribute is scaled by this value.
