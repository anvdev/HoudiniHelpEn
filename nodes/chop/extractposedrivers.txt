"""Creates channels from the specified derived transforms, node parameters and CHOP channels for pose-space deformation."""

This CHOP creates a set of channels from a specified set of pose-drivers. For each driver, one or more channels are created and named with this node's name and the driver index. Their values are determined by the driver's type. For a Transform driver, the channels are derived from the specified OBJ node using the transform type and mapping to select and map the object's transforms. For the Parameter driver, the channels retrieved as parameters from the specified OBJ node. For a Channel driver, the channels are retrieved from the specified CHOP node. 

This CHOP is used by the [Pose-Space Deform SOP|Node:sop/posespacedeform], which indirectly finds this node in its provided geometry library.

@parameters

== Drivers ==

Show All Parameters:
    Disabling this toggle simplifies the interface to make the parameters and the values easier to work with.

Geometry Path:
    Path to a SOP node containing bone capture attributes from which the transforms are derived. Usually the SOP node will lie upstream of a [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/bonedeform] because it removes the bone capture attributes by default.
    
Skeleton Root Path:
    Specifies the parent OBJ for the bones attached to the input geometry. The `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute is used by default when this parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute in the input geometry.

Channel Name Prefix:
    Specifies a prefix for the name of the channels created by this node. If empty the name of this node is used as the channel name prefix.

Number of Drivers:
    Number of drivers. Each driver creates one or more channels in the output.

Type:
    Specifies the source of the driver channels.

    Local Transform:
	    Specified OBJ node's local transform.
    Effective Local Transform:
	    Product of the specified OBJ node's pre-, local, region and constraint transforms.
    Object Local Transform:
	    Transform of the specified OBJ node relative to the subnet given by the __Skeleton Root Path__.
    Relative Transform:
	    Transform of the specified OBJ node relative to the _Relative OBJ Node__.
    World Transform:
	    Specified OBJ's world transform.
    CRegion World Transform:
	    Product of all transforms influencing the specified OBJ node including its capture region.
    Parameter Path:
	    Select parameters of interest on the OBJ at the __Skeleton Root Path__.
    CHOP Channel Path:
	    Select channels of interest produced by the __CHOP Channel Path__.

OBJ Node:
    Specified OBJ node for pose-drivers.

Transform:
    Specifies the transform of interest for this transform driver, usually a combination of rotation, scale, and translation. Rotations are given in Euler rotation angles. Other driver transforms include:

    Quaternion (Rot.):
	    Euler rotations are changed to Quaternion coordinates. The negated quaternion coordinates are also output.
    Dual Quaternion (Rot. and Tran.):
	    Euler rotations and Cartesian translations are changed to dual Quaternion coordinates. The negated rotation quaternion coordinates are also output.
    Matrix Exponential:
	    The transformation matrix is changed to the exponential of the transformation matrix.

CHOP Channel Path:
    Specifies the path to a CHOP node and channel (e.g. `/obj/chopnet1/constant1:chan1`).

Parameter Path:
    Specifies the path to a node and parameter (e.g. `/obj/chain_bone1/r`).

Relative OBJ Node:
    Specifies the parent OBJ node that is used with __Relative Transform__ type drivers.

Scale:
    Scaling may be necessary to modulate driver values that are much larger or smaller than those produced by other drivers.

Offset:
    Offset is applied before scaling to center its range of values.

== Channel ==

Channel Range:
    Specifies the range of data to generate.

    Use Full Animation Range:
        All of the animated range.
    Use Current Frame:
        Only the sample at the current frame.
    Use Start/End:
        The range is specified from the __Start__ and __End__ parameters.
Start:
    #channels: /start

    The start time of the channel range.
End:
    #channels: /end

    The end time of the channel range.
Extend Left:
    The left extend condition (before the CHOP's start).
Extend Right:
    The right extend condition (after the CHOP's end).
Default Value:
    #channels: /defval

    The value to use for the "Default Value" extend condition type.
