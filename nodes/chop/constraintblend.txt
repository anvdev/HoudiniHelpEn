"""Combines two or more chops by using a list of weights specified as parameters."""

The Constraint Blend CHOP combines two or more chops by using a list of weights specified as parameters. This node works similar to the [Blend SOP|Node:sop/blendshapes].

== Advantages of Difference Method ==

Each blend input affects the result without reducing the effect of the others. You can exaggerate beyond each of the inputs by setting their Blend > 1, and you can also use negative values. When all blend weights are 0, you get smooth transitions as any of the blend channels ease out of zero.


@parameters

== Blend ==

Method:
    The blend method.

    Proportional:
        Each blend source contributes to the result according to its
        blend weight. If the blend weights do not add up to one,
        they are scaled so that they do.
    Difference:
        The input 1 is always the "base", which is the default behavior of the Blend CHOP.
        The blend weight 1 is always ignored.
        There are blend channels for all the other inputs, and when they are all zero, you get base.
        If any one blend weight is 1 and the others are zero, then
        your output is the same as the input that corresponds to
        that blend channel.
