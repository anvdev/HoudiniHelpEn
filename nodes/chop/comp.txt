"""Layers (blends) the channels of one CHOP on the channels of another CHOP."""

This CHOP layers (blends) the channels of one CHOP on the channels of
another CHOP. The first input is the base input and the second is the
layer input.

Over the interval of the layer, the layer channels are blended with the
base channels. The contribution of the layer is eased-in and eased-out
according to the __Start__, __Peak__, __Release__ and __End__ parameters. The base is
unaffected outside the interval of the layer.

The __Effect__ parameter determines the amount of contribution of the
layer.

If __Base Hold__ is 0, the layer input will completely replace the base
input when the effect is 1. If __Base Hold__ is 1, the layer will be added
to the base.

The interval of the output starts at the minimum of the base and layer.
The interval of the output ends at the maximum of the base and layer.
The base's extend conditions are used if the layer lies outside the
base.

If the third input is supplied, the Effect page will be overridden by
the third input's first channel, which should contain the effect values
over the range of the layer.


@parameters

== Composite ==

Base Hold:
    #channels: /base

    Determines how much of the base to blend into the output at
    points where the layer has an effect.
    
Match By:
    Matches channels in the base input with ones in the layer input by either index or name. __Channel Union__ causes layer channels that are not in the base to be added to the
    output.
    
Match Failure:
    It is sometimes desirable to produce a warning or an error
    when channels in the first input fail to be correctly matched
    to channels in the other inputs. A failure may occur when
    matching by __Channel Number__ if the base input has more channels
    than the layer input, or when matching by __Channel Name__ if a
    channel name in the base input cannot be found in the layer input.
    
Quaternion Blend:
    Aids in producing smooth rotation blending. The "quaternion" attribute should be in the input CHOP. See the [Attribute CHOP|Node:chop/attribute].
    
Shortest Path Rotation Blending:
    If on, compensate for cyclic channels (such as angles) by always choosing the shortest route between samples when blending.
    
Rotation Scope:
    Defines which channels are rotations for __Shortest Path Rotation Blending__.
    
Cycle Length:
    #channels: /cyclelen

    The length of the cycle for __Shortest Path Rotation Blending__.

== Effect ==

Effect:
    #channels: /effect

    Sets how much the layer affects the output. If 0, the output
    is the base.
    
Unit Values:
    Sets the meaning of the next four parameters. Either absolute values, relative to the start/end of the channel, or relative to the current frame. The layer and base are
    never shifted.
    
Start:
    #channels: /start

    The beginning of the composite interval. Effect is zero at this point.
Peak:
    #channels: /peak

    Where the composite operation reaches maximum effect. This value is held until the release point.
Release:
    #channels: /release

    The point at which the effect begins to fall back towards
    zero.
End:
    #channels: /end

    The end of the composite operation's effect. The effect reduces to zero again.
    
Rise/Fall Shape:
    The shape of the segment between the __Start__ and __Peak__ indices, or between __Release__ and __End__.

@locals
