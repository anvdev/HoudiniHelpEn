= Channel VOP =

"""Contains a VOP network that can manipulate channel data."""

This node contains a [VOP network|/nodes/vop] (double-click the node in the network editor to go inside it), which can use [CHOP context |/vex/contexts/chop] VOPs to manipulate channel data. 

NOTE:
    To define a CHOP using a (textual) VEX program instead of a VOP network, use the [Channel Wrangle|Node:chop/channelwrangle] instead.

NOTE:
    If you create a __Transform VOP__ node using the [Tab menu|/basics/tabmenu], it creates a Channel VOP and sets it to work with transform channels and constraints.

NOTE:
    Use [Get Channel Value/nodes/vop/chinput] node to query channel values from
    other inputs at different samples index and channel index.


This node is useful for creating "one-off" programs to manipulate channel data in a single network.
