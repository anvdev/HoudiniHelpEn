= Stash Pose =

"""Stashes the bone transforms and pose-drivers for use by the Pose-Space Deform SOP and Pose-Space Edit SOP nodes."""

This CHOP acts like a stash for storing a pose's transforms and drivers for the [Pose-Space Deform SOP|Node:sop/posespacedeform] and [Pose-Space Edit SOP|Node:sop/posespaceedit] nodes. The node takes three inputs: an [Extract Pose-Drivers CHOP|Node:CHOP/extractposedrivers] for the value of the pose drivers in the current frame, an [Extract Bone Transforms CHOP|Node:CHOP/extractbonetransforms] for the bone transforms in the current frame, and a [Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel] for the pose. 

Updating the stash while the pose's [Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel] is exported stashes its bone transforms and pose drivers. The bone transforms are used by the [Deform SOP|Node:SOP/deform] to deform the rest geometry into the given pose and the pose drivers are used by the [Pose-Space Deform SOP|Node:sop/posespacedeform] to interpolate between pose-space edits.
