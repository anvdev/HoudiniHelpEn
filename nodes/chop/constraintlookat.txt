= Constraint Lookat =


"""Constrains rotation so it always points toward a target position."""

The Constraint Lookat CHOP computes rotations to make an object axis point towards a position.
By default, the rotation is computed to point the Z- axis towards a target while orienting the Y+ axis towards an up vector.
This is to match the way cameras and lights are defined.
The lookat can work with Target, Up Vector, and Twist defined by input channels or by parameters.
It's also possible to customize which axis is the lookat axis and which axis is the up axis.
If the first input is provided, the rotation on the input will be overwritten, otherwise transformation channels are created and the rotation is computed.
If the second input is provided, the Look At Position from the channels are used.
If the third input is provided, the Look Up Position from the channels are used.
If the fourth input is provided, the Twist from the channels are used.

@parameters

== Lookat ==
Look At Axis:
    Define which of the 6 axis ( X-,Y-,Z-,X+,Y+,Z+) points at the __Look At Position__.
Look Up Axis:
    Define which of the 4 allowed axis act as the up direction.
    The allowed axis change based on the __Look At Axis__.
    You can't use the same axis to define the look at and up directions.

Look At Position:
    Define which of the 6 axis ( X-,Y-,Z-,X+,Y+,Z+) points at the __Look At Position__.

Look Up Mode:
    __Look Up Vector__ can be computed with a Position, a Vector or a Quaternion.
    In __Quaternion__ mode, the up direction is automatically computed using original orientation and the look at position.

Look Up Position:
    Look up position in world space.

Look Up Vector:
    Look up vector in world space.

Twist:
    Twist angle in degrees around the __Lookat At Axis__.
