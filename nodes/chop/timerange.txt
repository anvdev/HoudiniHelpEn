= Time Range =

"""This converts an input node in Current Frame mode to a Time Range mode by re-cooking it multiple times."""

This converts an input node in Current Frame mode to a Time Range mode by re-cooking it multiple times. It has no effect on nodes that aren't time dependent and in Current Frame mode.

@parameters

== Time Range ==

    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The start of the interval.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The end of the interval.
    Cache Time Range:
        #channels: /cachetimerange

        Prevent the node from recooking by caching the evaluation.
    Clear Cache:
        #channels: /clearcache

         Clears the cache.

@locals
    S:
        The start of the input clip, in samples.
    E:
        The end of the input clip, in samples.
    L:
        The length of the input clip, in samples.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1). 

	With this variable, channels can be shifted relative to one another.
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
