= Extract Locomotion =

"""Extracts locomotion from an animation clip."""

The Extract Locomotion CHOP removes the root translation and orientation from an animation clip, and places it in a separate set of channels.
This node can be useful when preparing animation clips for agent primitives, and provides the same behavior as the [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent].

The input channel names are expected to follow the `transform_name:parameter_name` format, where `parameter_name` is a name matching `[xr]Ord t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz]`.

@parameters

SOP Path:
    The path to a SOP containing an agent primitive.
    The agent's rig will be used as the transform hierarchy for the locomotion extraction.
    If the geometry contains multiple agent primitives, the first primitive in the __Group__ will be used.

Group:
    Specifies a primitive group for the SOP geometry.

Locomotion Node:
    #id: locomotionnode
    Name of the transform in the hierarchy that controls the locomotion of the character (i.e.  the node that has translation channels that move it forward in space).

Locomotion Orient:
    #id: locomotionorient
    Optional name of a transform in the hierarchy, which is used to extract an overall rotation using the vector from the __Locomotion Node__ to this transform.

Convert to In-Place Animation:
    #id: converttoinplace
    Specifies whether to convert the animation to an in-place clip in addition to recording the locomotion transform.

[Include:/nodes/sop/agent#projectondominantaxis]

Input Transform Order:
    The transform order to use when the `xOrd` channel is absent.

Input Rotation Order:
    The rotation order to use when the `rOrd` channel is absent.

Input Space:
    Specifies whether the input channels are local or world space transforms.

Channel Name:
    Prefix to use for the channels that will contain the locomotion transform.

Output Transform Order:
    The transform order of the output channels.

Output Rotation Order:
    The rotation order of the output channels.

Output Space:
    Specifies whether the output channels should be in local or world space.
