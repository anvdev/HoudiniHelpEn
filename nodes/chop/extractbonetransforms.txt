= Extract Bone Transforms =

"""Extracts the current world or local space bone transforms from a geometry object."""

This CHOP extracts the current world or local space transforms of the bones associated with the specified geometry object. The transforms are converted to channels for each bone's translation, rotation, and scale. This CHOP can be used as the target for the [Bone Deform SOP's|Node:sop/bonedeform] __Transforms Path__.

Pose-space deformation uses this CHOP to derive the world transforms of each pose-shape. The transforms are stored stored by the [Stash Pose CHOP|Node:chop/stashpose].

@parameters

== Transforms ==

Geometry Path:
    Path to a SOP node containing bone capture attributes from which the transforms are derived. Usually the SOP node will lie upstream of a [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/bonedeform] because it removes the bone capture attributes by default.

Skeleton Root Path:
    Specifies the parent OBJ for the bones attached to the input geometry. The `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute is used by default when this parameter is empty. If this parameter is non-empty, it overrides the `pCaptSkelRoot` detail attribute in the input geometry.

World Space Bone Transforms:
    Toggle off to output local bone transforms.

Absolute Channel Paths:
    Enable to make the output channels names match the absolute paths to the bones that produced their values. By default the paths are relative to the __Skeleton Root Path__.

== Channel ==

Channel Range:
    Specifies the range of data to generate.

    Use Full Animation Range:
        All of the animated range.
    Use Current Frame:
        Only the sample at the current frame.
    Use Start/End:
        The range is specified from the __Start__ and __End__
        parameters.
Start:
    #channels: /start

    The start time of the channel range.
End:
    #channels: /end

    The end time of the channel range.
Extend Left:
    The left extend condition (before the CHOP's start).
Extend Right:
    The right extend condition (after the CHOP's end).
Default Value:
    #channels: /defval

    The value to use for the "Default Value" extend condition type.
