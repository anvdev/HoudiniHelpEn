= Time Shift =

"""This time-shifts a CHOP, re-cooking the node using different time."""

This time-shifts a CHOP, re-cooking the node using different time. It is different the from CHOP Shift node, which modifies the start and end time of the evaluated clip. You can use this node on CHOP nodes that are in Current Frame mode.

@parameters

== Time Shift ==

    Unit Values:
        Determines how the __Start__ and __End__ parameters are are to be
        interpreted.

        Absolute:
            The __Start/End__ parameters are the actual start/end position.
            It is used to shift the CHOP to start at `0` seconds, for
            example.
        Relative to Current Frame:
            Ignore the start/end parameters and use the current frame as
            the new start position.
    Start:
        #channels: /start

        The start of the interval, absolute or relative to the input
        CHOP.
    End:
        #channels: /end

        The end of the interval, absolute or relative to the input
        CHOP.

    Time Shift:
        #channels: /timeshift

        The amount to shift the channel.
    Recompute Input:
        #channels: /recomputeinput

        Recompute the input node at the original time after cooking at a different time.

@locals
    S:
        The start of the input clip, in samples.
    E:
        The end of the input clip, in samples.
    L:
        The length of the input clip, in samples.
    C:
        The current channel (0 to NC-1). 

	With this variable, channels can be shifted relative to one another.
    NC:
        The total number of channels.
