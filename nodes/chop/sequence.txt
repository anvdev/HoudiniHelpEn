"""Takes all its inputs and appends one chop after another."""

This CHOP takes all its inputs and appends one CHOP after another. It is
expected they all have the same channels.

The end section of the first CHOP is overlapped with the start section
of the second CHOP, and so on for the rest of the input CHOPs. The
second input is shifted to line up with the end of the first.

Blending allows you to splice channels together by slowly phasing out
one CHOP while phasing into the next, or by inserting interpolation
curves between the channels of the adjacent chops.

__Quaternion Blend__ blends rotation triplets (rx ry rz) together using the
shortest rotation arc. Rotation triplets are identified by "quaternion"
attributes, which are set in the [Attribute CHOP|Node:chop/attribute].

__Translation Blending__ blends translation channels together by slowly
changing from the final velocity of the previous channel to the initial
velocity of the next. The next channel may be shifted up or down. If
this is undesirable, use cubic blending instead (in the Shape menu).
__Translation Blending__ is done on channel triplets that represent
translations or positions (*tx *ty *tz).


@parameters

== Blend ==

Method:
    The blend method to use to produce a seamless sequence.

    Preserve Length:
        Keeps the total length of the channel constant.
    Overlap Sequences:
        Overlaps the current cycle with the last cycle. Audio
        sequences should always use this method.
    Insert Blend Region:
        Inserts a region between the cycles where the blending
        is done.
Shape:
    Blend interpolation shape. See [Cycle CHOP|Node:chop/cycle].
    
Region:
    #channels: /blendregion

    The size of the blend region in number of samples.
Bias:
    #channels: /blendbias

    Which segment to favor when blending: the previous (-1), the next (+1) or none (0).
    
Match By:
    Match channels between inputs by index or by name.
    
Match Failure:
    It is sometimes desirable to produce a warning or an error when channels in the first input fail to be correctly matched to channels in the other inputs. A failure may occur when matching by __Channel Number__ if an input has fewer channels than input 1, or when  matching by __Channel Name__ if a channel name cannot be found in input 1.

== Scope ==

Step:
    #channels: /step

    If set to 1, the next segment will be shifted up or down so that it begins where the last segment ended.
    
Step Scope:
    The names of channels that use the Step function.
    
Blend Scope:
    The names of the channels that should be blended. Other channels will not be blended at all.
    
Translate Blend:
    The names of channels that will be translation-blended. Each string field contains a list of its component channels, such as x, y or z.

== Rotate ==

Quaternion Blend:
    Use quaternion blending on rotation channels. All inputs should have quaternion attributes for the rotation channels to determine the rotation order.
    
Shortest Path Rotation Blending:
    If on, compensate for cyclic channels (such as angles) by always choosing the shortest route between samples when blending.
    
Rotation Scope:
    Defines which channels are rotations for __Shortest Path Rotation Blending__.

Cycle Length:
    #channels: /cyclelen

    The length of the cycle for __Shortest Path Rotation Blending__.
