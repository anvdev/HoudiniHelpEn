"""Reads in channel data from an FBX file."""

This CHOP reads in animation from an [FBX file|/io/fbx] for use by CHOPs.
FBX files can be loaded through the [File CHOP|Node:chop/file], but this node provides a more convenient interface for the FBX-specific import options.

Take Name:

    Override:
        Change the file's sample rate to a new rate.
    Resample:
        Change the file's sample rate to a new rate and keep the
        time range constant.

Sample Rate:
    The new sample rate to use if Override or Resample is selected.
