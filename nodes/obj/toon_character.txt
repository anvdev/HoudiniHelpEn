"""A ready-to-animate Toon Character."""

The Toon Character is a full featured cartoon animation rig, which is animation-ready. The Toon Character rig comes with built-in deformation, facial shapes, as well as squash and stretch ability.

NOTE:
    To control the skin's rendering parameters (Matte, Phantom, Shading Quality, etc.), attach a Properties SHOP in the __Rendering Properties__ parameter on the __Shading and Eyes__ tab.

@parameters

Skin LOD:
    Controls the mesh resolution of the character.

Display Skin:
    Displays the deforming geometry of the character.
    
=== Animation ===

Control LOD:
    Changes the level of display for all rig animation controls.

Set Animation Defaults:
    Sets all animation parameter values to their default values.

==== Switchers ====

The controls on this tab are for blending different spaces and control systems.

Head World Space Blend:
    Blend between local and world space for rotations.

FK/IK Blend:
    Blends between forward and inverse kinematic solutions.

Match FK to IK:
    Matches the FK rotations to the IK solver end positions.

Match IK to FK:
    Matches the IK solver end positions to the FK rotations.

Stretch Ratio:
    Controls the stretch ratio for IK body parts.  A value of 0 is no stretch, and a value of 1 is full stretch.  Stretch is a percentage of the distance between the end of the bone and IK control.

Wrist World Space Blend:
    Blend between local and world space for rotations.

Curved Arm:
    Applies an effect that causes the arm to appear curved at the mid joint.
    
Custom Control Space:
    Provides a custom control space to IK solutions.  This allows you to lock the controls to an object in world space, independent of the rig space.
    
Custom Space Blend:
    Blend between the standard and any custom IK space.

Curved Knee:
    Applies an effect that causes the knee to appear curved at the mid joint.
    
==== Facial Controls ====

	Use an object from the scene.

    From File:
	Use a geometry object from a disk file.

Scene Object:
    Path to an object network from the scene.

File Path:
    File path to eye geometry.

=== Animation Data ===

Generate Mocap Rig:
    Generate a motion capture rig asset from the character.

Source File:
    Load Autorig animation data from a file.

Refit Tolerance:
    Tolerance to use when attempting to refit raw keyframes.

Read/Reload:
    Apply the animation in the specified file to the rig, with keyframes
    being refit using the tolerance.

File Path:
    File to write keyframe data to.

Write Keyframe Data:
    Convert the current animation to keyframes and write out to the
    specified file.
