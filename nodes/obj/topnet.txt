@parameters

== Cook Controls ==

Generate Static Work Items:
    #id: generatestatic
    Generates static work items in all nodes in the TOP network. None of the 
    work items will be cooked, and dynamic nodes will do nothing.

Cook Output Node:
    #id: cookbutton
    Cooks the output node in the TOP network.

Dirty All:
    #id: dirtybutton
    Dirties all work items in all of the TOP nodes inside the network.

Cancel Cook:
    #id: cancelbutton
    Cancels the current cook, if one is running.

== Save/Load Task Graph ==

Save Task Graph:
    #id: savetaskgraph
    Saves the state of all work items to an external file, which can be restored
    using the __Load Task Graph__ button. The task graph is saved to the path
    specified in the __Task Graph File__ parameter.

Load Task Graph:
    #id: loadtaskgraph
    Dirties the network and loads the task graph file in the __Task Graph File__
    parameter.

Auto Save Rate:
    #id: taskgraphsaverate
    When this parameter is enabled, TOPs will save the task graph to disk at
    regular intervals. The save rate is specified in seconds.

== Scheduler ==

Default TOP Scheduler:
    #id: topscheduler
    Specifies the default scheduler node that will be used by all TOP nodes,
    unless the TOP node has its own scheduler override.
