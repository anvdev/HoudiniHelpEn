"""Creates the internal components of a muscle (the rig), by stroking a curve onto a skin object."""

The Muscle Rig object is the same set of handles and inner core found in a [Icon:OBJ/muscle][Muscle|/nodes/obj/riggedmuscle] object. 

When constructing a hybrid muscle ([Icon:OBJ/frankenmuscle][Franken Muscle|/nodes/obj/frankenmuscle]), you can use the Muscle Rig object to draw an independent inner core for use with your arbitrary muscle geometry.

Use the muscle rig inputs to attach parents to the head and tail anchors of your inner core.  You can do this manually by wiring objects directly into the inputs, or you can use the [Attach To Bones|/shelf/muscle_attachmuscles] shelf tool to attach multiple muscle rigs at once in your scene view.

NOTE:
     This node can only be created using the [Muscle Rig shelf tool|/shelf/muscle_rig]. It is not available in the Network Editor's [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu].

For tool information see: [Icon:OBJ/musclerig][Muscle Rig|/shelf/muscle_rig].

== Geometry ==

Unlike a Muscle, a Muscle Rig does not have its own built-in geometry. However, a small subset of geometry parameters are required to be present here as they are pertinent to the interplay among this and other muscle assets. 


==== Build Settings ====

Construction Radius:
    The XYZ radii of the of a virtual muscle that is used to compute the radius of the inner core.  This parameter exists to make internal nodes compatible with Muscles.  
    

[Include:/nodes/obj/riggedmuscle#shapetab]


== Capture/Deform ==

    A muscle's geometry is first constructed using its build parameters in a static state, and then deformed into the "animated" or "live" position dictated by the muscle rig handles.  An cage deformer is constructed by sweeping a cross section along the central curve of the inner core.  This cage deformer is used to capture the muscle geometry in its rest state, or capture pose, and reshape the captured muscle according to the position and orientation of the muscle rig handles.
    The capture pose is subsequently an important aspect of a muscle's rig configuration as the rest of the muscle system will rely on the existence of this pose as a base position for the initial orientation of muscle geometry.
    
    Edit Capture Pose:
        When active, the musclerig will be displayed in its __Capture Pose__.  When muscle rigs are displayed in the __Capture Pose__, they can easily be distinguished from "live" muscle rigs by their appearance. The muscle rig handles will change from the being "round" to being "boxy". 
        
        Handles can be manipulated in the viewport when this mode is active, however, each handle node will be transformed independently of its sibling nodes.  This contrasts the "live" behavior of the handles where manipulating the end handles will affect the handles transformations on the interior.
    
    Set Capture Pose:
        This button will record the muscle rig's current position and construction parameters into the capture state and use the current appearance of the muscle as the __Capture Pose__.
        
    Copy Capture Pose to Current Pose:
        This button does the inverse of the __Set Capture Pose__ button. The stored capture state parameters are extracted from the __Capture Pose__. The current pose is set to match the capture pose. 
    
    === Inner Core ===
    
        The inner core is comprised of a central spline curve that is governed by the handle locations, and, a hull built by sweeping a cross section along this spline.  The hull acts as a deformation cage that becomes part of a biharmonic capture mesh, which ultimately deforms the static rest state of a muscle into its animated, live position.

== Dynamics ==

=== Anchor Regions ===

Anchor regions are used to constrain a muscle and affix it to a parent transformation when simulated with dynamics.  

In a conventional muscle setup, the end handles of a muscle rig each carry a constraint region that affects freedom of movement of the muscle geometry nearby.  The scale of this constraint region will encapsulate more or less of the nearby muscle geometry.  The geometry contained with the bounds of the anchor region will be constrained using the strength and damping parameters found on the containing asset of the muscle geometry.

Muscle Rig assets only supply the constraint regions with their corresponding radii.

Display Regions:
	Toggle this parameter to display the scale of the muscle anchor regions.  The regions are located at either end handle.  Once displayed, the regions can be selected and scaled interactively in the viewport.
	
Head/Tail Radius:
	The anchor region radius.

== Display ==

Display:
    Use this toggle to control the display visibility of this muscle rig asset in the viewport.
    
Handles:
    Display toggle for the muscle rig handles.
    
Inner Core:
    Display toggle for the inner core.

Display inner Core as Wires:
    The inner core can optionally be displayed as a polygonal cage, or as flow lines from end to end.
    
Single Wire:
    Optionally display the inner core as the central spline only.
    
Color:
    The color ramp applied to muscle geometry.  This parameter is for compatibility with other muscle assets.
