"""Microsolver to create Vellum constraints during a simulation."""

The Vellum Constraints DOP allows the creation of new Vellum constraints
dynamically during a simulation.   It is a microsolver so should be wired to one of the solver inputs of the __Vellum Solver DOP__.  It can also be wired inside of a __Vellum Solver SOP__.

To change existing constraints, the __Vellum Constraint Update DOP__ should
be used.

@parameters

Activation:
    #id: activate

    Controls if the microsolver is solved at all.  Can be used to add
    constraints on a specific frame, for example.


Create Constraints:
    #id: createmode

    How frequently to try and create constraints.   Some types of constraints you wish to create just once, and in this case the On Creation Frame simplifies the setup.   Dynamic constraints you may wish to create less frequently than every substep as creating and destroying constraints will slow the simulation.

    On Creation Frame:
	Apply the creation rules only on the specified creation frame.

    Each Frame:
	Apply the creation rules once every frame, but not more frequently.

    Each Substep:
	Apply the creation rules every substep.  This has the greatest accuracy, but creating constraints can slow the simulation.


Creation Frame:
    #id: createframe

    Which frame to create constraints on.
