= FEM Target Constraint =

"""Constrains an FEM object to a target trajectory using a hard constraint or soft constraint."""

This involves constraining a set of points on the soft body object to a target animation. The soft body object may be a [Solid Object|Node:dop/solidobject], [Hybrid Object|Node:dop/hybridobject], or [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject].

The target animation may be specified by the point attribute `targetP` on the soft body object's geometry. In the case of the Solid Object and the Hybrid object, the target animation may also be specified using the __Target Deformation__ parameter instead of the `targetP` attribute.

This constraint provides a method for applying hard or soft constraints to individual points. If the __Type__ is set to __Hard__, the constrained points will follow the target trajectory exactly under all circumstances, even if collisions happen. If the __Type__ is set to __Soft__, the constrained points will approximately follow the target animation through the use of forces. The soft method is preferable for simulations that involve collisions. The higher the __Target Strength__, the larger the force that tries to match the simulated point positions to the target animation point positions. The __Target Damping__ parameter can be fine tuned such that the soft method does not overshoot the target.

The __Soft Controls__ on the Target Constraint work different from the __Target Strength__ and __Target Damping__ parameters on the [Solid Object|Node:dop/solidobject] and the [Hybrid Object|Node:dop/hybridobject]. The Target Constraint looks at individual points and it applies lumped force contributions at these points; the coefficients are not densities, but they control the entire contribution at each constrained point. In contrast, the parameters on the Solid/Hybrid Object and the corresponding point multipliers attributes control the densities of fields that are distributed over the entire object.

Target Constraints should be used when precise control over individual points is desired and the Target Controls on the Solid/Hybrid Object should be used when a smooth falloff of targeting forces is desired over a contiguous object.

SBD Constraint is a digital asset.

@parameters

== Constraint ==

Type:
    #channels: /type

    Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint.

Constrained Object:

    #channels: /group

    The soft body object to be constrained.

Constrained Points:
    #channels: /ptgroup

    The group of points on the object's geometry that are to be constrained. It is recommended to use the name of a group that is created in SOPs, instead of specifying a single point number or a hard-coded range (e.g., 1-99). This allows constraints to work in simulations where the topology is modified by a SOP solver.

== Soft Controls ==

Strength:
    #channels: /stiffness

    This determines how strongly the soft constraint matches the target positions.

Damping:
    #channels: /damping

    This determines how strongly the soft constraint matches the target velocities.

== Guide Options ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.
Radius:
    #channels: /guiderad

    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.
Color:
    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

    Controls the color of the guide geometry if using pin constraints.
Show Object Link:
    #channels: /showobjectlink

    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
