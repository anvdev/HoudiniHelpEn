= Vellum Object =

"""Creates a DOP Object for use with the Vellum Solver."""

The Vellum Object DOP creates a Vellum Object inside a DOP simulation. It
creates a new object and attaches the data which is needed for it to be
used as a Vellum Object.

The result is ready for use by the [Vellum Solver|Node:dop/vellumsolver].

@parameters

== Creation ==

    [Include:standard_objcreation]

== Initial Data ==

Initial Geometry:
    #id: displaysoppath

    Starting geometry for the Vellum simulation.  This represents the
    display or collision geometry.

    Usually new objects are created using the [Vellum Source
    DOP|Node:dop/vellumsource], this is most useful when restarting an existing
    simulation.


Display Geometry:
    #id: displaygeo

    Whether to display the geometry in the viewport.


Initial Constraints:
    #id: constraintsoppath

    Starting constraint geometry for the Vellum simulation.  This represents
    the constraints between points of the display geometry.  It should
    have a one-to-one point correspondence with the display geometry.

    Usually new objects are created using the [Vellum Source
    DOP|Node:dop/vellumsource], this is most useful when restarting an existing
    simulation.

Display Constraints:
    #id: displayconstraints

    Whether to display the constraint geometry in the viewport.  Usually
    constraints are displayed using the guides instead of showing the
    raw geometry.

== Guides ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    #id: showguide

    Whether to display guide geometry in the viewport.


Draw as Wireframe:
    #id: guide_wireframe

    Forces the guide geometry to draw as wireframe.
