= FEM Region Constraint =

"""Constrains regions of a solid object or a hybrid object to another solid or hybrid object."""

This constraint can be used to constrain objects together in a region where one object contains or overlaps the other object. This is a soft constraint, which means that the positions of the two objects don't match exactly in the region. Instead, the strength and damping of the constraints are used to generate internal energy densities. The __Strength__ parameter under the Soft Controls tab can be used how strong the soft constraint force is that keeps the points together. The corresponding __Damping__ parameter can be fine tuned to avoid oscillations of the soft constraint force due to overshooting.

@parameters

== Soft Controls ==
Strength:
    #channels: /strength

    If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls the strength of the soft constraint force that pushes the pairs of points together.

Damping:
    #channels: /damping

    If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls how the strength of the soft constraint force that matches the velocities of the constrained point pairs.

== Container Object ==

Object:
    #channels: /constrainedobject

    This is the container object in which regions will be registered.

Registration Attribute:
    #channels: /constrainedregistrationattribute

    This attribute defines the position that is used to register regions within the container object.

Enable Multipliers:
    #channels: /constrainenablemultipliers

    When this is turned on, multiplier attributes for the __Strength__ and __Damping__ will be applied within the container object.

Allow Partial Overlap:
    #channels: /constrainallowpartialoverlap

    Allow the constraint to take effect in places where the region object primitives overlap the container object but are not fully contained in it.

Strength:
    #channels: /constrainstrengthattribute

    A multiplier attribute for the __Strength__ within the container object.

Damping:
    #channels: /constraindampingattribute

    A multiplier attribute for the __Damping__ within the container object.

== Region Object ==

Object:
#channels: /goalobject

    This object defines regions inside the container object.

Registration Attribute:
    #channels: /goalregistrationattribute

    This attribute defines the position that is used to register regions within the container object

Enable Multipliers:
    #channels: /goalenablemultipliers

    When this is turned on, multiplier attributes for the __Strength__ and __Damping__ will be applied within the container object.

Allow Partial Overlap:
    #channels: /goalallowpartialoverlap

    Allow the goal to take effect in places where the region object primitives overlap the container object but are not fully contained in it.

Strength:
    #channels: /goalstrengthattribute

    A multiplier attribute for the __Strength__ within the container object.

Damping:
    #channels: /goaldampingattribute

    A multiplier attribute for the __Damping__ within the container object.

== Matching Attributes ==

Enable Matching:
    #channels: /enablematching

    Enable the use of the __Part Identifier Attribute__ to restrict registration to matching identifiers.

Part Identifier Attribute:
    #channels: /identifierattribute

    If this attribute is present on both the container object and the region object, then regions are only registered against parts of the container object that have the same identifier.

== Guide Options ==

Show Guide Geometry:
    Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.

Radius:
    #channels: /guiderad

    Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.

Color:
    #channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

    Controls the color of the guide geometry.

Show Object Link:
    #channels: /showobjectlink

    Controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
