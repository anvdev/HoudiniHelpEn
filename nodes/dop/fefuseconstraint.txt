= FEM Fuse Constraint =

"""Constrains points of a solid object or a hybrid object to points of another DOP object."""

This constraint can be used to connect a list of points to a list of corresponding points on another object. When __Type__ is chosen to be HARD, the fused points effectively become a single point for the purposes of the simulation. When __Type__ is chosen to be SOFT, then the points don't need to be at the exact same position. In the SOFT case, the points may be kept close together using a special soft constraint force. The __Strength__ parameter under the Soft Controls tab can be used how strong the soft constraint force is that keeps the points together. The correspondign __Damping__ parameter can be fine tuned to avoid oscillations of the soft constraint force due to overshooting.

@parameters

== Constraint ==

    Type:
        #channels: /type

        Whether to use a hard constraint or a soft constraint. Hard constraints are always enforced exactly. The soft constraints create forces instead.

    Object A:
        #channels: /constrainedobject

        The object to fuse to another object.

    Points A:
        #channels: /constrainedpoints

        The ordered list of constrained points.

    Object B:
        #channels: /goalobject

        The object to which to fuse.

    Points B:
        #channels: /goalpoints

        The ordered list of goal points.

== Soft Controls ==

    Strength:
	#channels: /strength

	If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls the strength of the soft constraint force that pushes the pairs of points together.

    Damping:
	#channels: /damping

	If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls how the strength of the soft constraint force that matches the velocities of the constrained point pairs.

== Guide Options ==

    Show Guide Geometry:
	Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.

    Radius:
	#channels: /guiderad

	Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.

    Color:
	#channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

	Controls the color of the guide geometry.

    Show Object Link:
	#channels: /showobjectlink

	Controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
