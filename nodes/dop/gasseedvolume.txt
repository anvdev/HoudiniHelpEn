"""A microsolver that seeds flip particles into a new volume region."""

The Gas Seed Volume DOP is a microsolver used in building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Seed Volume DOP creates flip particles in a new volume region.
This can be used to fill in new space that is formed when the simulation volume
moves. This is useful when simulating a small moving patch of a larger fluid region.

@parameters
Particles:
    The geometry data which will have particles added to it. No existing
    particles will be taken into account.
Surface:
    A signed distance field representation of the current surface
    in the fluid simulation. This field is used entirely as a reference
    for creating new particles in the appropriate voxel locations.
New Volume Field:
    A signed distance field representing the surface in the new
    volume region. Particles will be created inside the surface
    according to the voxelization determined by the surface field.
Velocity Field:
    A vector field representing the velocity field in a new volume
    region. Particles created in the new volume will be assigned
    a velocity according to this velocity field.
Particle Velocity Attribute:
    Velocity will be applied to the indicated attribute for all newly created particles.
Slice Index Field:
    An index field that indicates the slice number that a region of a
    simulation corresponds to. If an index field voxel does not match 
    the slice number, a particle will not be created.
Particles Per Voxel:
    The number of particles to be created per voxel cell. The voxel size
    and position is determined by the surface field.
Surface Oversampling:
    Oversample particles by this multiple when within __Oversampling Bandwidth__
    of the surface.
Oversampling Bandwidth:
    Oversample within this number of voxels from the surface or any __Surface__
    volume boundaries, if __Oversample at Boundaries__ is enabled.
Oversample At Boundaries:
    Oversample within __Oversampling Bandwidth__ voxels of the boundaries of the __Surface__ volume.
Use pscale Attribute:
    This toggle determines whether the particle radius used to reseed at the 
    new surface is derived from the `pscale` attribute or the user-provided
    value below.
Surface Offset:
    When created particles, they will be offset from the surface based on this radius. The default is 0, meaning the particles will be placed exactly on the surface.
Volume Size:
    The size of the new simulation volume. This is used to help determine where the new volume region is positioned in the simulation.
Volume Center:
    The center position of the new simulation volume. This is used to help
    determine where the new volume region is positioned in the simulation.
Seed:
    The seed to the random number generator that determines the position of a newly created particle.
Slice Number:
    If non-negative, only particles from this slice will be eligible as seeds.
    This avoids wastefully seeding particles in external slices that will be
    eliminated in the next border update.  This only takes effect if the 
    slice index field is also provided.
