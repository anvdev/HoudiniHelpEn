"""Creates a crowd object with required agent attributes to be used in the crowd simulation."""

The result is ready for use by the [Crowd Solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver].

@parameters
    Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
        Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini frames (`$F`) or to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  

	The latter is affected by the offset time and scale time at the DOP network level.
    Creation Frame:
        The frame number on which the object will be created. The object is created only when the current frame number is equal to this parameter value. This means the DOP Network must evaluate a timestep at the specified frame, or the object will not be created. 
    Enable Ragdoll Data:
        Specifies whether to create the point attributes required for solving the agent with the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

    Source:
        #id: initialgeometrysource
        Specifies the source of the __Initial Geometry__.
        This may be a SOP path, or a SOP connected to one of the DOP network's inputs.

    Initial Geometry:
        The path to a SOP containing the initial geometry for the crowd object.

    Use Object Transform:
        Specifies whether the transform of the object containing the __Initial Geometry__ is applied to the geometry.

    Add ID Attributes:
        Assigns a value to each agent for the `id` point attribute, and updates the `nextid` detail attribute.

    Life Expectancy
        The life expectancy of the agent, in seconds. This is used when __Reap Particles__ is enabled on the crowd solver.

    Source:
        #id: clipgraphsource
        Specifies the source of the __Clip Transition Graph__ geometry.
        This may be a SOP path, or a SOP connected to one of the DOP network's inputs.

    Clip Transition Graph:
        The path to a SOP containing geometry that describes how clips are allowed to [transition to each other|Node:dop/crowdtransition#cliptransitiongraph].

    Source:
        #id: clippropertiessource
        Specifies the source of the __Clip Properties__ geometry.
        This may be a SOP path, or a SOP connected to one of the DOP network's inputs.

    Clip Properties:
        #id: clipproperties
        The path to a SOP containing geometry that describes advanced options for how [clips should be played back|Node:sop/agentclipproperties].

    Source:
        #id: targetgeometrysource
        Specifies the source of the __Target Geometry__.
        This may be a SOP path, or a SOP connected to one of the DOP network's inputs.

    Target Geometry:
        The path to a SOP containing the target geometry for agents whose `crowdanimated` point attribute is non-zero.

    Use Object Transform:
        Specifies whether the transform of the object containing the __Target Geometry__ is applied to the geometry.

    == Physical ==

    Density:
        #channels: /density

        The mass of an object is its volume times its density.

    Rotational Stiffness:
        #channels: /inertialtensorstiffness

        When an object receives a glancing blow, it will often
        acquire a spin. The amount of spin acquired depends on the
        shape and mass distribution of the object, known as the
        _inertial tensor_. 
        
        The Rotational Stiffness is a scale
        factor applied to this. A higher stiffness will make the
        object less liable to spinning, a lower value will make it
        more ready to spin.
            
    Bounce:
        The elasticity of the object. If two objects of bounce 1.0 collide, they will rebound without losing energy. If two objects of bounce 0.0 collide, they will come to a standstill.

    Friction:
        The coefficient of friction of the object. A value of 0 means the object is frictionless.
