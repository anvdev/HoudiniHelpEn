= Glue Constraint Relationship =

The Glue Constraint Relationship DOP is one of several constraint relationship data types. These constraint relationships can be attached as subdata to a [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] node to control the relationships defined by the constraint network.

In a Glue Constraint Relationship, the objects move as one whole object until enough force is applied to break the glue bond.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Strength:
    #id: strength
    Specifies the strength of the glue bond. If the value is -1, the connection will never break.

Half-Life:
    #id: impulse_halflife
    The number of seconds for the glue impulse to decay by one half. Whenever a glued object gets hit, it accumulates a glue impulse force. This controls how fast that force decays.

Propagation Rate:
    #id: propagate_rate
    Specifies how much the impacts propagate along each glue bond in a [Constraint Network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork].

Propagation Iterations:
    #id: propagationiterations
    Specifies the number of impact propagation iterations for the glue bond.
    If this value is less than zero, the global number of iterations will be used (which is specified by the `propagate_iteration` detail attribute on the [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork#attributes]).

    When a glued object is hit, its impact value is spread along the constraint network to other glue bonds.
    This allows distant glue bonds that are weak to be broken prior to nearer, strong bonds.
    The impact propagations is the number of rounds of propagation to do.
    Impulses will not travel more than this number of bonds each solve step.

== Guide Options ==

Color:
        Controls the color of the constraint guide geometry.
