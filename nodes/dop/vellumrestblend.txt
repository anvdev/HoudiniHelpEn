= Vellum Rest Blend =

"""Blends the current rest values of constraints with a rest state calculated from the current simulation or external geometry."""

The Vellum Rest Blend DOP allows mixing the current rest values of constraints, including rest length and rest angles, with a rest state calculated from the current simulation or external geometry.  When the rest source is the current simulation geometry, this DOP provides an effect similar to controlled plasticity.  Using external geometry, you can achieve other effects such as purposefully stretching or putting bends into cloth or hair, or inflating an object over time.

If this DOP is used inline with a [Vellum Source|Node:dop/vellumsource] DOP, the blending will only apply to points in the [stream|/dopparticles/streams] created by that node.  In this way you can use separate external rest geometry for each Vellum patch sourced.

@parameters

Activation:
    #id: activate

    Controls if the microsolver is solved at all.

Update Frequency:
    #id: updatemode

    How frequently to blend rest states.

    Single Frame:
        Blend the rest states only on the specified __Frame__.

    Each Frame:
        Blend the rest states once every frame, but not more frequently.

    Each Substep:
        Blend the rest states every substep.  This has the greatest accuracy, but can slow the simulation.


Creation Frame:
    #id: activationframe

    Which frame to blend rest states when __Update Frequency__ is set to __Single Frame__.

== Blend ==

    [Include:/nodes/sop/vellumrestblend#congroup]

    Source:
        #id: restsource

        Specifies the source of the rest geometry from which to calculate the rest state for blending.   __Simulation Geometry__ will use the current state of the simulation, which can be useful to control effects similar to plasticity, "baking" the current simulation state into the constraints.  __SOP__ specifies external geometry, which should have the same topology as the original input geometry.
