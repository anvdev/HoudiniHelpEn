"""Applies anticipatory avoidance force to agents/particles to avoid potential future collisions with other agents/particles."""

This is a [crowd behavior|/crowds/states] node, but you can also use it on regular particles (see the __Output attribute__ parameter).

@parameters

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#activate]

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#partgroup]

[Include:standard_pop_parms#guideParms/]

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#output]

[Include:crowd_steer_parms#weight]

Particle Scale Multiplier:
    #id: particlescale
    The node uses `pscale` as the size of each agent/particle when calculating potential collisions.
    You can use this parameter to scale the value of `pscale` in the calculation, letting you allow agents/particles to be more or less tightly packed.
    This parameter can be overridden by a `pscalemultiplier` point attribute.

Force Scale:
    #id: forcescale
    Scaling factor for the strength of the avoidance force.

Anticipation Time:
    #id: lookaheadtime
    How far into the future an agent will look for possible collisions (this uses current velocity to project the possible distance). The maximum distance for which an agent considers another agent as a neighbor is the minimum of the agent's current speed multiplied by the Anticipation Time, and the Neighbor Distance. 

Neighbor Group:
    Specifies the agents/particles that should be considered when searching for nearby agents.

Neighbor Distance:
    #id: ndist
    Maximum distance an agent searches for other nearby agents.

Max Neighbors:
    #id: maxneighbors
    Maximum number of nearest neighbors to an agent to consider when computing the agent avoidance force.
