""" Creates a Whitewater Object that holds data for a whitewater simulation. """

The Whitewater Object DOP creates a Whitewater Object inside the DOP
simulation. It creates a new object and attaches the subdata required for the 
[Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] to operate.

@parameters

== Creation ==

Creation Frame Specifies Simulation Frame:
    Determines if the creation frame refers to global Houdini frames (`$F`) or
    to simulation specific frames (`$SF`).  The latter is affected by the offset
    time and scale time at the DOP network level.
    
Creation Frame:
    The frame number on which the object will be created. The object is created
    only when the current frame number is equal to this parameter value. This
    means the DOP Network must evaluate a timestep at the specified frame, or
    the object will not be created. 
    
    For example, if this value is set to 3.5, the __Timestep__ parameter of the
    DOP Network must be changed to `1/(2*$FPS)` to ensure the DOP Network has a
    timestep at frame 3.5.
    
Object Name:
    The name for the created object.  This is the name that shows up in the
    details view and is used to reference this particular object externally.  
    
    NOTE:
        While it is possible to have many objects with the same name, this
        complicates writing references, so it is recommended to use something
        like `$OBJID` in the name.

Solve On Creation Frame:
    For the newly created objects, this parameter controls whether or not the
    solver for that object should solve for the object on the timestep in which
    it was created. 
    
    Usually this parameter will be turned on if this node is creating objects in
    the middle of a simulation rather than creating objects for the initial
    state of the simulation.

Allow Caching:
    By preventing a large object from being cached, you can ensure there is
    enough room in the cache for the previous frames of its collision geometry.

    This option should only be set when you are working with a very large sim.
    It is much better just to use a larger memory cache if possible.

== Physical ==

Bounce:
    The elasticity of the object. If two objects of bounce 1.0 collide, they
    will rebound without losing energy. If two objects of bounce 0.0 collide,
    they will come to a standstill.
    
Bounce Forward:
    The tangential elasticity of the object. If two objects of bounce forward
    1.0 collide, their tangential motion will be affected only by friction. If
    two objects of bounce forward 0.0 collide, their tangential motion will be
    matched.
    
Friction:
    The coefficient of friction of the object. A value of 0 means the object is
    frictionless. 
    
    This governs how much the tangential velocity is affected by collisions and
    resting contacts.
    
Dynamic Friction Scale:
    An object sliding may have a lower friction coefficient than an object at
    rest. This is the scale factor that relates the two. It is not a friction
    coefficient, but a scale between zero and one. 
    
    A value of one means that dynamic friction is equal to static friction. A
    scale of zero means that as soon as static friction is overcome the object
    acts without friction.

== Guides ==

=== Particles ===

Color Particles by Depth:
    #id: showtype
    When enabled, whitewater particles will be colored by depth. The actual
    color is determined from __Visualization Range__ and __Color Ramp__.

Visualization Range:
    #id: guiderange
    Horizontal axis of the __Color Ramp__ corresponds to this depth range.

=== Repellants ===

Repellants:
    #id: repellantcolor
    Enabling this option will render the repellants as spheres of the given
    size and color.

Visualize Attribute:
    #id: repattribute
    When enabled, repellant colors are derived from the value of this point
    attribute.

    NOTE:
        See documentation for the [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver]
        for a list of repellant attributes.

Visualization Mode:
    #id: guidevismode
    Specifies the color spectrum used for visualizing repellant attributes. When
    mode is set to __Ramp__, the custom __Color Ramp__ is used.

Detect Range:
    #id: guidedetectrange
    When enabled, the range of values for the visualization attribute will be
    automatically calculated; if this option is disabled, the provided
    __Visualization Range__ is used instead.

Visualization Range:
    #id: guiderange3
    When __Detect Range__ is disabled, the visualization attribute is colored
    based on its value relative to this range.

=== Fields ===

The surface and velocity fields sourced from the input fluid simulation can be
visualized in a number of ways. The help for
[Scalar Field Visualization|Node:dop/scalarfieldvisualization] and
[Vector Field Visualization|Node:dop/vectorfieldvisualization] 
provides more details about how these work.

NOTE:
    Field visualization will only work if __Import Volumes__ is enabled on the
    [Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver].
