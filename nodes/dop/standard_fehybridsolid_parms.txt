Stiffness Multiplier:
    #channels: /solidstiffness

    This is a convenient multiplier for both the __Shape Stiffness__ and the __Volume Stiffness__ of the solid tets. This multiplier has no units.

Damping Ratio:
    #channels: /soliddampingratio

    This unitless parameter controls how quickly the solid tets stop deforming.

Mass Density:
    #channels: /solidmassdensity

    This is the density of mass per volume for the solid tets.

Material Model:
    #channels: /solidmaterialmodel

    Choose the model that determines how the material resists deformation.

Shape Stiffness:
    #channels: /solidshapestiffness
    
    This determines how strongly the solid tets resist local changes in shape.

Volume Stiffness:
    #channels: /solidbendstiffness
    
    This determines how strongly the solid tets resist local changes in volume.
