= Agent Clip Layer =

"""Layers additional animation clips onto an agent."""

This node layers additional animation clips on top of the agent's base animation clip, and the clips can be applied to a subset of the agent's skeleton.
This is useful for introducing variation into a crowd shot, such as by adding clips with upper body motion on top of a walk cycle.
Multiple [Agent Clip Layer DOPs|Node:dop/agentcliplayer] may be wired together to create several layers.

@parameters

Group:
    Only affect a group of agents out of all the agents in the state.

=== Layer ===

Blend Mode:
    Specifies the blend mode to use for the layer.

    Interpolate:
        Interpolates between the base pose and the clip's pose according to the __Blend Ratio__.

    Additive:
        Applies a percentage of the clip's rotations and translations to the base pose, as specified by the __Blend Ratio__.
        Typically the layered clip will be a _difference_ clip, where the channels contain the [difference from a reference pose|Node:chop/posedifference] rather than the actual pose.
        This is useful for adding additional variation while preserving the characteristics of the base animation.

Clips:
    Specifies the number of clips in the layer.

Randomize Clips:
    [Include:crowdstate#randomizeclips/]

Clip Name:
    #id: clipname_#
    The name of an animation clip.

Random Seed:
    [Include:crowdstate#randomclipseed/]

Clip Groups:
    [Include:crowdstate#numclipgroups/]

    Clip Names:
        [Include:crowdstate#clippattern/]

    Weight:
        [Include:crowdstate#clippatternweight/]

Transform Group:
    The name of a [transform group|Node:sop/agenttransformgroup], which specifies a subset of the transforms in the agent's rig that the clip should be applied to.
    Transform groups can be created using the [Agent Transform Group SOP|Node:sop/agenttransformgroup].

Blend Ratio:
    Specifies how to blend between this clip and the base layer.
    When the __Blend Mode__ is __Interpolate__ a value of 0 will have no effect, and a value of 1 will completely override the base layer.
    When the __Blend Mode__ is __Additive__, the value specifies the percentage of the clip's rotations that are added to the base layer.

Weight:
    #id: weight_#
    If there are multiple clips in the layer, specifies the weight used when blending between each clip.

Activate with Trigger:
    Start playing back the clip when the specified input [crowd trigger|Node:dop/crowdtrigger] becomes active.

Play Once:
    Specifies that the clip will only be played through once, instead of playing until the trigger is released.

Blend In Frames:
    When the trigger is activated the clip will be blended in over the specified number of frames.

Blend Out Frames:
    When the trigger is released, the clip will be blended out over the specified number of frames.

Set Initial Clip Time:
    If enabled, overrides the initial clip time for the animation clip.
    Otherwise, the initial clip time will be inherited from the state's base animation clip.

Initial Clip Time:
    [Include:crowdstate#initialcliptime/]

Randomize Clip Time:
    [Include:crowdstate#randomizecliptime/]

Random Clip Offset:
    [Include:crowdstate#randomclipoffset/]

Random Seed:
    [Include:crowdstate#randomclipoffsetseed/]

Override Clip Speed:
    If enabled, controls how fast the animation clip should be played back.
    Otherwise, the clip speed will be inherited from the state's base animation clip.

Clip Speed Multiplier:
    [Include:crowdstate#clipspeedmultiplier/]

Randomize Clip Speed:
    Randomly adjusts the __Clip Speed Multiplier__ for each agent.

Variance (%):
    [Include:crowdstate#clipspeedvariance/]

Random Seed:
    [Include:crowdstate#clipspeedseed/]
