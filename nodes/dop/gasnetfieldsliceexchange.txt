"""A microsolver that exchanges boundary data between multiple
machines."""

The Gas Net Field Slice Exchange DOP is a microsolver used in
building larger fluid
simulations. The [Fluid Solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver] and [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver] DOPs that allow
microsolvers to be added before or after the main solver step to extend
or tweak the simulation. Alternatively, enterprising people may attempt
to build an entire new solver out of microsolvers.

The Gas Net Field Slice Exchange DOP exchanges the field values along
the border of slices defined by slice planes in a distributed
simulation.   It differs from Gas Net Field Border Exchange in that
the boundaries are determined by explicit simulation slices, not by
the slice settings of the field themselves.

@parameters
    Fields:
	The scalar, vector, and matrix fields to exchange.  
	Voxels that are owned by other slices and are within the bandwidth will
	be copied over.

	Note:
	    The slice settings of the fields are not used, instead the
	    slice root data is used to determine voxel ownership.

    [Include:standard_distribution]

    Slice Data Root:
	The root data to build our slice topology from.

    Slice Overlap:
	The distance in world space to extend the slices.

    Voxel Overlap:
	The distance in voxels to extend the slices.
