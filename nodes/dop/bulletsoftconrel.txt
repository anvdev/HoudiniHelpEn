= Bullet Soft Constraint Relationship =

The soft constraint is one of several constraint relationship data types. These constraint relationships can be attached as subdata to a [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] node to control the relationships defined by the constraint network.

Like [spring constraints|Node:dop/springconrel], soft constraints apply a force that is proportional to the distance between the anchors, but there are some differences in behavior between the two constraint types.
The soft constraint is significantly more stable, and will not blow up in situations that are troublesome for the spring constraint (e.g. very stiff springs or objects with small masses).
However, some artificial damping is produced with larger timesteps, so more substeps are necessary to produce the behavior of an undamped spring with a soft constraint versus a spring constraint.
The soft constraint's parameters are not mass-dependent, unlike the spring constraint, so tuning their behavior in a constraint network with objects of varying masses can be much easier.

This constraint type is only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

== Data Options ==

Rest Length:
    This parameter allows the relationship to be satisfied when the anchors are separated by a non-zero distance.

    If this value is non-zero, then the anchors will actually be pushed apart in an attempt to maintain the specified rest length between them.

Stiffness:
    #id: stiffness
    Specifies the strength of the force that attempts to match the transforms of the two anchors.

    This value is equivalent to the frequency of a spring.

Damping Ratio:
    #id: dampingratio
    Specifies how much damping is applied to the motion.
    A value of 0 specifies no damping, and a value of 1 provides just enough damping to prevent oscillation.
    Values between 0 and 1 allow oscillation (with some damping), and values greater than 1 provide increasingly damped motion that has no oscillation.

    This value is equivalent to the damping ratio of a spring.

== Guide Options ==

Radius:
    Indicates the radius of the sphere that appears at the constraint anchor positions in the viewport as guide geometry.
    Whether or not to display the guide geometry depends on the [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] to which this relationship is attached.

Color:
    Controls the color of the constraint guide geometry.

Show Object Link:
    This parameter controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
