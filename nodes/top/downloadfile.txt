"""Downloads the contents of one or more URLs into files."""


== Overview ==

This node creates work items that download content from a static list of URLs into files on disk. You can choose to batch all downloads into one work item (for small downloads), or launch separate processes for each download.

You can use a `file://` URL to copy the contents of one file to another. (See also the [File Copy node|Node:top/filecopy]).

You will usually want to override this node to run on a local scheduler, and leave __Split downloads into separate work items__ turn off, since in general, the overhead of scheduling and launching separate processes dwarf the download time unless the files are very large. However, you can try testing with the split checkbox on and off.

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Split Downloads Into Separate Work Items:
    #id: split

    Create separate work items for each URL to download them in parallel. When this is off, the node creates one work item to download the URLs serially. You may want to turn this on if you are downloading very large files. 

File Downloads:
    #id: url_list

    Use this multiparm to set up the URLs to download.

URL:
    #id: url#

    The URL of the file to download.

Tag:
    #id: file_tag#

    The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to apply to the output files.

Filename:
    #id: output_filename#

    The file path to download the content into. If you turn off the checkbox, the node will pick a name based on the URL's base name and place it in the working directory.
