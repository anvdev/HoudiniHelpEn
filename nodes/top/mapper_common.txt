Use Dynamic Mapping:
    #id: pdg_dynamicmap

    By default, a mapper will establish dependencies between upstream static
    work items and downstream static work items. When this toggle is enabled,
    a second mapping pass will be done between any dynamic items above the
    mapper and static items below the mapper.

    The dynamic items will be prefiltered based on the static mapping defined
    by the node, such that only dynamic items that descend from the selected
    static items will be considered.
