= Wait for All =

"""Waits for all upstream work items to complete."""


== Overview ==

This node puts all input work items into a single partition with an `index` of 0.
This creates dependencies on all input work items, so this node waits for all upstream work to finish.
You will often use this at the end of the network (before cleanup and notification nodes),
and also in the network where you need everything in a branch to finish before moving on to the next step.


== Partition nodes == (parts)

Wait for All is a type of [partitioner|/tops/intro#parts].
Different partition nodes group together upstream work items in different ways.
The main effect of partitioning items is that the partition only proceeds after all work items in the partition finish.
Partitioning also groups together the attributes of the individual work items into list attributes on the partition.
