"""Encodes a sequence of still images as a video file."""

The opposite operation (extract frame images from a video) is in the [FFmpeg extract images node|Node:top/ffmpegextractimages].


== Installation == (install)

This node is a wrapper around the `ffmpeg` command line tool. *You must have FFmpeg installed* on each machine for this node to work.

* You can specify an explicit path to the executable using the node's 

* If the __FFmpeg path__ parameter is blank, the node looks for the environment variable `PDG_FFMPEG`, which if defined should contain a path to the executable.

* If the `PDG_FFMPEG` variable is not defined, the node will assume the executable is in the system path.


@top_attributes

::`operation`
    #type: string

    Indicates the ffmpeg operation (`"encode"`).

::`overridebin`
    #type: integer

    Whether the user specified a custom `ffmpeg` executable path.
    If this is `1`, the work script should use the executable path in the `ffmpegbin` attribute.

::`ffmpegbin`
    #type: string

    The path to the `ffmpeg` executable, if `overridebin` is `1`.

::`fps`
    #type: integer

    The playback speed of the output video in frames per second.

::`framelistfile`
    #type: string

    The file path of the text file that contains the list of input frame images.

::`outputfilename`
    #type: string

    The file path of the output video file.

::`customcommand`
    #type: integer

    When this is `1`, the work script will run the custom command line in `expr`.

::`expr`
    #type: string

    A custom command line to run, when `customcommand` is `1`.

::`outputtag`
    #type: string

    The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to put on the result file path.

::`inputimages`
    #type: string

    List of file paths to the frame images.

@parameters

== Node ==

Frames Per Second:
    #id: fps

    The playback speed of the output video.

Frame List File:
    #id: framelistfile

    The file path to the frame list file. The frame list file is a text file
    that contains an ordered list of all of the input images to FFmpeg that are
    used to construct the video.

    It is a requirement of FFmpeg that the paths of the images in this file are
    specified as relative paths. Therefore, when running on Windows, the frame
    list file *must* be placed on the same drive as the input images.

Output Filename:
    #id: outputfilename

    The file path to write the output video to.

Output Tag:
    #id: outputtag

    The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to put on the output file path. The default is `file/video`.

FFmpeg Command:
    #id: expr

    Turn this on to customize the command line passed to `ffmpeg`.

FFmpeg Path:
    #id: ffmpegbin

    Turn this on to set an explicit path to the `ffmpeg` executable.
    If this is off, the node will look for a `PDG_FFMPEG` environment variable.
    If the variable is not set, the node will simply assume the executable is on the system path.
