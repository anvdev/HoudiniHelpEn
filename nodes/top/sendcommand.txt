= Command Send =

"""Sends code to a shared server to execute"""

This node is used with a shared server created using either a [Command Server|Node:top/commandserver],
[Houdini Server Begin|Node:top/houdiniserver] or [Maya Server Begin|Node:top/mayaserver] node.

It can be used send a command or custom code to the server, depending on what the
server accepts. The Houdini server runs Python code that uses the HOM API, the
Maya server uses MEL or Python and the generic command server uses the format defined by
its server implementation.

When executing python code, the __pdgcmd__ module is available to be imported, which provides functions to report data back to PDG.  As well, a __work_item__ object is available which has a subset of the __PyWorkItem__ API.

When used with a Maya server, the script text is assumed to be python code unless `//mel` is the first line of the script, in which case the script text is treated as MEL code.  The result of a MEL script is whatever the last line of the script evaluates to.

@top_attributes
::`commandfile`:
    #type: str

    The path to the file containing a serialization representation of the
    __Command Script__.

@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Shared Server Name:
    #id: sharedservername

    The name of the shared server to communicate with. When this parm is
    disabled, the node will use the shared server information from upstream
    work items.

Result Data Tag:
    #id: resultdatatag

    If the command produces results, which is not already tagged, the data will be tagged with this string.

Command Script:
    #id: commandstring

    The code to send to the shared server. If the server is a Houdini Server
    this should be Python code, and can make use of the HOM API. If the server
    is a Maya Server this parm should contain MEL code.
