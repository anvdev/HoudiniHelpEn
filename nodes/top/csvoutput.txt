"""Writes work item attributes to a CSV file."""

This node allows a CSV file to be created from work item attributes and result
data. Data queries can be added to specify which data from the work item should
get written to the outputted CSV file.

Normally one row will be written for each work item in the upstream item. For example, if
the node generates from a single upstream item, there will only be one row in
the CSV file. If the node generates from a partition which contains 10 work
items, the CSV file will contain 10 rows.  Setting __Multiple Values per Query__ to
__Add Rows__ may result in multiple rows being generated for a given item.


@parameters

== Output ==

CSV File:
    #id: csvfilepath

    Specifies the output path of the CSV file.

Output Tag:
    #id: resultdatatag

    Specifies the [file tag|/tops/filetags] for the result.

Write Header:
    #id: writeheader

    Specifies whether the node should write a header to the CSV file. If this is
    enabled, a header row will be written to the CSV file where each header is
    the name of the attribute or the result data tag.

Column Delimiter:
    #id: delimiter

    When enabled, specify a character to use to delimit columns in the file.  Typically
    this is a comma or tab character.

Error if Tag Match Fails:
    #id: errorifnomatch

    If this is enabled, the node will raise an error when no match is found for
    any of the data queries.

When Multiple Values:
    #id: multiplevalueshandling

    If there are multiple values found for the given query, how they should be written.
    For example if the query is "file/geo", there may be multiple results for a given item.
    Since

    Add Rows:
        An extra row should be written for each value returned.

    Add Columns:
        Each value will be written as a new column.

Attributes to Write:
    #id: querymode

    Selects how to specify the attributes to be written to the CSV file.

    By Data Queries:
        Select this to specify work item attributes by the __Data Queries__ multiparm.  The order
        of the multiparm will be the order of the columns in the file.

    By Attribute:
        Select this to specify an attribute from which to read the names of attributes to dump
        to CSV.  The attribute should be a string array attribute which contains names of attributes
        on the workitems.  The order of the names will be the order of the columns in the file.

Data Queries:
    #id: dataqueriesmult

    This is a multi-parameter that contains all of the data queries that should
    be performed.

Attribute Name / Tag:
    #id: dataqueriesmult#

    This parameter is the actual query that will be performed on the upstream
    item. It can be either an attribute name or a [file tag|/tops/filetags].

    The position of this parameter within the multi-parameter list determines
    the column that the data will be written to.
