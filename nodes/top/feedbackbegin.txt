@top_attributes

The names of these attributes can be configured using parameters on the node.

::`loopiter`:
    #type: [int]

    The loop iteration number. This attribute can be an array of values when using nested feedback loops, since the iteration number at each level is preserved. The loop iteration value for the outer most loop is stored in `loopiter[0]`, the next level is stored in `loopiter[1]`, and so on. In this case, you would use `loopiter[loopnum]` to get the current loop iteration.

::`loopnum`:
    #type: int

    Tracks which loop the work item is associated with. This attribute is
    relevant when generating multiple independent loops in the same feedback
    begin node, for example by driving the feedback begin node with a
    [Wedge|Node:top/wedge] node.

::`loopsize`:
    #type: int

    The total number of iterations in the current loop.

TIP:
    If you have nested loops, you may want to give the `loopiter`/`loopsize` attributes different custom names at each nested level to avoid having to deal with arrays.


@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Iterations from Upstream Items:
    #id: iterationsfromupstream

    Set the number of iterations based on the number of incoming static work items, instead of the __Iterations__ parameter.

Iterations:
    #id: iterations

    If the Begin node has upstream items, the loop runs this number of times for each incoming item.

Copy Inputs For:
    #id: copyinputsfor

    Determines how input files should be copied onto loop items. By default, upstream files are copied onto all input files, however it's also possible to only copy input files onto the first iteration or none of the loop iterations.

    No Iterations:
	Upstream input files are not copied to the outputs of any loop iteration items

    First Iteration:
	Upstream input files are copied to the output file list only for the first loop iteration

    All Iterations:
	Upstream input files are copied to the output file list of all iterations.

~~~~ Loop Attribute Names ~~~~

These parameters can be used to customize the names of the work item attributes created by this node.

Iteration:
    #id: iterattribute

    The name of the attribute containing the work item's iteration number.

Number of Iterations:
    #id: sizeattribute

    The name of the attribute containing the total iteration count.

Loop Number:
    #id: numattribute

    The name of the attribute that stores the loop number.
