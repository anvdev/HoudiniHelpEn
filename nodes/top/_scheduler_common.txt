Working Directory:
    #id: pdg_workingdir

    The relative directory where the work will be generating intermediate files 
    and output. The intermediate files will be placed in a subdirectory. 
    Typically $HIP is used. For running jobs on the farm, the working directory
    would typically be a mounted directory on all client machines, including
    the machine scheduling the work.


Local Shared Root Path:
    #id: localsharedroot

    The absolute path to the mounted directory on the local machine which the 
    working directory is rooted at.
    
    
Remote Shared Root Path:
    #id: remotesharedroot

    The path to the mounted directory on client machines which the working 
    directory will be rooted at. This can include variables that the farm is set
    to resolve to platform-specific paths. If using the default value of 
    __PDG_SHARED_ROOT__ then __PDG_SHARED_ROOT__ should be mapped to the actual
    mounted value for each operating system used by clients. It can be set to 
    other values that clients are already using in an existing farm.


Override Port Range:
    #id: overrideportrange

    Enable to override the callback server's default port range.
    
    
Callback Port Range:
    #id: callbackportrange

    The callback server's port range values to use when overriding the
    default values.
