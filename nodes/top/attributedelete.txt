"""Removes attributes from work items."""

This node deletes a list of attributes (or all attributes) from incoming work items. (More correctly, it outputs clones of the incoming work items, but filters out matching attributes).


@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Delete When:
    #id: condition

    If you turn this on, the node only removes the attribute(s) below from work items where the given expression evaluates to a non-zero value. The expression does not have to involve the attributes being deleted. For example, to remove attributes from any work items whose `tile_x` attribute is greater than 5, turn on __Delete when__ and set the expression to `@tile_x > 5`.

Delete All Attributes:
    #id: deleteall

    Delete _all_ custom attributes. This does not affect internal attributes such as `pdg_index` and `pdg_output`.

Attributes:
    #id: attributes

    A multi-parm allowing you to delete one or more attributes by name.

Attribute:
    #id: name

    The name of the attribute to delete.

Index:
    #id: index

    When this is on, instead of removing the attribute, the node will _truncate_ the attribute _value_ after a certain position. For example, if you set this to `1`, the node will delete any vector components after the first, effectively setting the vector size to 1.
