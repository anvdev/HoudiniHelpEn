= Partition by Bounds =

"""Partitions source items spatially using the bounding items."""

A partition is created for each bounds item, and includes all of the source items that overlap with that bounds item. This is done by comparing each source item with each bounds item, using the Compiled Block to do the test.

The default internal Compiled Block creates a Bounding Box for the bounds item to do the overlap test. This test can be overridden by specifying another external Compiled Block. The Compiled Block must return non-empty geometry if there is overlap. Therefore an empty geometry result means that there is no overlap.

This allows to override the default intersection test by specifying another Compiled Block.
    
Compiled Block:
    #id: blockpath

    The Compiled Block used for the overlap test. The default Compiled Block uses a Bounding Box for the bounds item. The Compiled Block returns non-empty geometry if there is overlap. Therefore an empty geometry result means that there is no overlap.

Compiled Block Bounds:
    #id: inputname1
    
    When using another Compiled Block, as an override, this should specify the Block Begin Compile's Input Name, so it can be used to forward the bounds input items.

Compiled Block Source:
    #id: inputname2

    When using another Compiled Block, as an override, this should specify the Block Begin Compile's Input Name, so it can be used to forward the source input items.
