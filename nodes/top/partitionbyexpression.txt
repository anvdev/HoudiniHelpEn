= Partition by Expression =

"""Partitions work items based on an expression"""

This node partitions input work items using an expression.

@parameters

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_dynamicpartition]

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Expression ==

Filter Work Items:
    #id: prefilter

    When enabled, this expression will be used to filter work items prior to
    evaluating the __Partition Expression__. The filter is evaluated against 
    each work item, and if the result is 0/false then the work item will not
    be considered when partitioning.

Partition Expression:
    #id: partition

    This expression is evaluated once for each input work item, and the resulting
    integer value determines which partition to put the work item into.

    For example, using the HScript expression `@pdg_index` will put the work 
    items into partitions based on their index. The same functionality can
    be achieved using the Python expression `work_item.index`.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
