= Invoke =

"""Invokes a compiled block on input geometry"""

This node can be used to run a SOP compiled block on input geometry. The
geometry can either be from result data on an upstream work item, or the
in-memory geometry representation produced by the
[Geometry Import|Node:top/geometryimport] TOP node.

When generating from partition, the invoke will expand the partition items
into separate inputs to the compiled block.

@top_attributes

::`outputpath`:
    #type: string

    The path that the work item where the work item will write its output
    geometry, if the __Write Output__ parameter is enabled.

::`pointcount`:
    #type: integer

    The number of points in the output geometry.

::`sourceindex`
    #type: integer array

    The indices of the upstream items that were used as inputs to the Invoke
    operation. `sourceindex[0]` is the first input to the compiled block,
    `sourceindex[1]` is the second input, and so on.

@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Compiled Block:
    #id: blockpath

    The path to the compiled block end node.

Evaluation Time:
    #id: time

    When this parameter is enabled it overrides the time used when evaluating
    the block. By default, the compiled block will be evaluated at the frame
    value specified on the work item, or at time=0 if no frame is set.

Input Geometry:
    #id: inputgeometry

    The number of inputs passed to the compiled block. Must be at least one,
    and can only be more than one when generating from a partition.

Block Input Name:
    #id: inputname

    The name of the input as specified on the corresponding compiled block begin
    node.

Write Output:
    #id: writeoutput

    When this parameter is enabled, the results of the compiled block will be
    written to disk.

Output Path:
    #id: outputpath

    The path to write the resulting geometry, if __Write Output__ is turned on.
