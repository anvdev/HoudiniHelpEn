[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Range ==

Range Type:
    #id: rangetype

    Determines how the work item range is specified.

    Custom:
	Custom range based on a ratio of upstream items to partition count and
	an offset in the left/right directions.

    Fixed Count:
	Creates a fixed number of partitions no matter how many upstream work
	items there are. Upstream items are distributed as evenly as possible
	amongst the partitions. If the items don't divide evenly, the first
	few partitions will have an extra work item.

    Fixed Size:
	Creates partitions of a fixed size when possible. If the upstream items
	don't divide evenly, only the last partition will have the wrong size.
	It will contain whatever items are left after dividing the upstream
	items into groups of the desired fixed size.

    First/Last:
	Creates exactly two partitions. The first one contains the first work
	item from each of the input nodes, and the second partition contains the
	last work item from each of the input nodes. Other upstream items are
	not partitioned.

    First/Middle/Last:
	Create exactly three partitions. Behaves the same as the __First/Last__
	range type, except the middle work items from each input node are also
	put into a partition.

=== Custom Range ===

These parameters configure the behavior of the partitioner when the __Custom
Range__ type is selected. The range is determined by two main properties: the
ratio of upstream work items to partitions, and an offset in the left and
right direction.

For example, with __Upstream Range__ set to 2 and __Partition Range__ set to 1,
one partition will be created for every two upstream work items.

Upstream Range:
    #id: upstreamrange

    Along with the __Partition Range__ parameter, determines the ratio between
    upstream work items and partitions

Partition Range:
    #id: parititionrange

    Determines the number of partitions to create, along with the __Upstream 
    Range__ parameter.

Left Offset:
    #id: leftoffset

    The number of additional items proceeding the selected items that should
    also be included in the partitions.

Right Offset:
    #id: rightoffset

    The number of additional items that follow the selected items that should
    also be included in the partitions.

=== Fixed Count ===

Range Count:
    #id: rangecount

    The number of partitions that will be created.

=== Fixed Size ===

Range Size:
    #id: rangesize

    The number of upstream items that will be added to each partition.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
