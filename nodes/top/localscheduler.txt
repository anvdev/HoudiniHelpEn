= Local Scheduler =

"""Schedules work items on the local machine."""

This node is the default scheduler that executes work items on the local 
machine. Works items are scheduled to run in parallel based on either the number
of CPUs available on the local machine or specified by __Maximum CPUs to Use__.

To execute work items on a farm or remote machines, another scheduler should be
utilized such as [HQueue Scheduler|Node:top/hqueuescheduler].


@parameters

== Scheduler ==

These are global parameters for all work items using this scheduler.

[Include:_scheduler_common#pdg_workingdir]
    
    
Maximum CPUs to Use:
    #id: maxprocs

    The maximum number of processors to use to execute work items. Numbers
    greater than 0 indicate how many processors will be used. When this is set
    to 0, the number of processors used will be equal to the number of logical
    cores in the system divided by 4. A negative number indicates that the
    number of processors used will be the total logical cores minus the
    specified number. 
    
Use HDA Pools:
    #id: local_usepool

    Enabling this will limit the number of Houdini sessions created for
    executing HDAProcessor work items. These sessions will be managed in a pool
    and reused.
    
    
HDAProcessor Pool Size:
    #id: hdaprocessorpoolsize

    Specifies the maximum number of Houdini sessions to be created in the pool
    for executing HDAProcessor work items. These sessions are reused in order
    to reduce the overhead of creating and shutting down Houdini sessions.
    
    
== Job Parms ==

These job specific parameters can be overridden by each node under the 
__Local Scheduler__ tab on the node's __Schedulers__ parameter interface.

Single:
    #id: local_single

    Enabling this will force one work item to be executed at a time.
    
    
Use CPUs per Task:
    #id: local_is_CPU_number_set

    Enabling this will use the __CPUs per Task__ value when deciding the number
    of CPUs to use per work item.
    
    
CPUs per Task:
    #id: local_CPUs_to_use

    The number of CPUs to use for each work item.
    
    
Use Houdini Max Threads:
    #id: local_usehoudinimaxthreads

    Enabling this will set the __HOUDINI_MAXTHREADS__ environment to the value
    specified in __Houdini Max Threads__.
    
    
Houdini Max Threads:
    #id: local_houdinimaxthreads

    Maximum number of threads to use for each work item in Houdini. This sets 
    the __HOUDINI_MAXTHREADS__ environment value.
