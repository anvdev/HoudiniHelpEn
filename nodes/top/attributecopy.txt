"""Copies attributes from work items in one branch onto work items in another branch."""

This node has two inputs. It looks for work items in the second input that "match" items in the first input. The node can match items up by position (index), or match up items that share a certain attribute value. Then, when it generates outgoing items, for items that match, it copies a list of attributes from the items in the second input onto the items in the first input.

You can choose to __Exclude unmatched items__, in which case any work items from the first input that don't match items in the second input are discarded.

Copy Attributes from All Work Items:
    #id: copyall

    When this toggle is enabled, the attributes from all work items on the second input will be copied onto each of the work items on the first input. No Match By condition is used to filter the work items.

Match By:
    #id: matchby

    Whether to match by `index` value (roughly, match by position) or by an attribute.

Match Name:
    #id: matchname

    When __Match by__ is "Attribute", the name of the attribute to use to match up work items (items in the second input will match items in the first input that have the same value of this attribute).

Match Type:
    #id: matchtype

    When __Match by__ is "Attribute", the type of the attribute to match (Integer, Float, or String).

Excluded Unmatched Items:
    #id: excludeunmatched

    When this is on, items from the first input are only passed down to the output if they matched. Items that didn't match an item in the second input are filtered out. (Items are never passed down from the second input.)

Attributes to Copy:
    #id: copyname

    A space-separated list of names/patterns describing which attributes to copy from items in the second input onto items in the first input. The default is `*` (copy all attributes).

    For example, you could set this to `foo bar baz` to only copy those three attributes, or `file_*` to only copy attributes whose names start with `file_`.

Copy Result Data:
    #id: copyresults

    When this is on, also copy output filenames onto the items in the first input.
