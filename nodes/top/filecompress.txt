= File Compress =

"""Compress files into an archive."""

This node generates a work item for each incoming work item that takes all file results [tagged|/tops/filetags] `file` and compiles them into a compressed archive. The `output` result of each work item is the archive file.


@top_attributes

::`method`
    #type: string

    The compression method (for example, `"zip"` or `"tar.gz"`).

::`output_file`
    #type: string

    File path to the output archive file.

::`input_files`
    #type: string

    Array of path strings representing the source files compiled into the archive.


@parameters

Method:
    #id: method

    The archive method/format, ZIP or `tar.gz`.

Output Filename:
    #id: output_filename

    Turn this on to specify the file path of the output file. If this is off, the node will put the file in an undefined location with a default name, so you probably want to turn this on to make sure it doesn't cause conflicts with other file paths or file patterns.
