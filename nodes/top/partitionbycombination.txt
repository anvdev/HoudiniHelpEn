= Partition by Combination =

"""Partitions work items into pairs, triples, etc"""

This node partitions work items by creating combinations of work items. For
example, when the __Combination Size__ is set to 2 it will create a partition
for each pair of work items.

Mathematically this node will always create nCr partitions, where n is the
number of input work items and r is the __Combination Size__ parameter value.

@parameters

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_dynamicpartition]

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Combination ==

Custom Sort Key:
    #id: sortkey

    When this parameter is enabled, a custom sort key can be specified as 
    an expression. By default input work items are sorted based on their index.
    Work items are sorted prior to being partitioned, and the sort order will
    be preserved when creating the combinations.

Combination Size:
    #id: combinationsize

    The number of work items in each combination, and consequently the number
    of items in each partition. Setting this to 2 for example will create
    a partition for each pair of input work items.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
