#type:     node

"""Creates or sets an attribute on all incoming work items."""

This node lets you change internal attributes (`pdg_index`, `pdg_frame`, `pdg_priority`, `pdg_output`), as well as create/set custom attributes. If an attribute with the given name and type already exists, this will overwrite its size/value.


@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Create When:
    #id: condition

    If you turn this on, the node only creates/sets the attribute(s) below to work items where the given expression evaluates to a non-zero value. For example, to only set an attribute on work items whose `index` is greater than 5, turn on __Create when__ and set the expression to `@pdg_index > 5`.

Index:
    #id: indexvalue

    If you turn this on, the node sets each work item's internal `index` attribute to the result of the given expression. For example, to set each work item's index to be the value of its `foo` attribute minus one, turn on __Index__ and set the expression to `@foo - 1`.

Frame:
    #id: framevalue

    If you turn this on, the node sets each work item's internal `frame` attribute to the result of the given expression. For example, to set each work item's frame number to be the value of its `source_frame` attribute, turn on __Frame__ and set the expression to `@source_frame`.

Priority:
    #id: priorityvalue

   If you turn this on, the node sets each work item's internal `priority` attribute to the result of the given expression. Work items with higher `priority` values are scheduled before work items with lower numbers.

String Attributes:
    #id: stringattribs

    A multi-parm allowing you to add/set one or more string attributes.

Name:
    #id: stringname

    The name of the string attribute to add/set.

Value:
    #id: stringvalue

    The value of the string attribute. This can be an expression that is evaluated for each incoming work item, however remember that in string parameters you must put expressions inside back-ticks.

Integer Attributes:
    #id: integerattribs

    A multi-parm allowing you to add/set one or more integer attributes.

Name:
    #id: intname

    The name of the integer attribute to add/set.

Size:
    #id: intsize

    The vector size of the new integer attribute (1-4). Use `1` for a single scalar value, or `3` for a 3D vector.

Value:
    #id: intvalue

    The value for the new integer attribute. This can be an expression that is evaluated for each incoming work item.

Float Attributes:
    #id: floatattribs

    A multi-parm allowing you to add/set one or more float attributes.

Name:
    #id: floatname

    The name of the float attribute to add/set.

Size:
    #id: floatsize

    The vector size of the new float attribute (1-4). Use `1` for a single scalar value, or `3` for a 3D vector.

Value:
    #id: floatvalue

    The value for the new float attribute. This can be an expression that is evaluated for each incoming work item.

Result Data:
    #id: resultdata

    A multi-parm allowing you to add/set one or more output file paths. (TOPs tracks, for each work item, the file paths of files created by that work item. Often the item's [work script|/tops/stocknodes#script] updates this information automatically, but you can also use this node to set it "manually").

Value:
    #id: resultvalue

    A file path to add to each work item's list of file outputs. This can be an expression that is evaluated for each incoming work item.

Tag:
    #id: resulttag

    The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to apply to the added file path. For example, `file/geo` or `file/pic`. This can be an expression that is evaluated for each incoming work item, however remember that in string parameters you must put expressions inside back-ticks.

Check File Path:
    #id: resultcheckfilepath

    When this is on, the node checks whether the file path exists and is readable before adding it to a work item. If the file cannot be accessed, the node will error.
