= ROP Geometry Output =

"""Creates work items that cook an embedded ROP Geometry node """

This node is a subnet that contains a [ROP Fetch|Node:top/ropfetch] TOP node and
a ROP Network with a [ROP Geometry|Node:out/geometry]. The parameters on the ROP
Geometry node are promoted onto this node's interface.

The subnet also contains a SOP network as a dive target, which can be used with
the ROP Geometry. By default the built-in SOP network is disabled, and will
only be used when the __Use External SOP__ toggle is turned off.
