= Map by Expression =

"""Maps upstream work items to downstream work items using an expression"""

This node maps upstream static or dynamic work items to downstream static items
using an expression. For more complicated mapping logic, it may be easier to use
a [Python Mapper|Node:top/pythonmapper]

@parameters

[Include:mapper_common#pdg_dynamicmap]

== Expression ==

Map Static Expression:
    #id: mapstatic

    The expression used to determine which upstream static items should be
    mapped to which downstream static items.

Map Dynamic Expression:
    #id: mapdynamic

    When __Use Dynamic Mapping__ is enabled, this parameter can be set to
    defined the expression used to map upstream dynamic items to downstream
    static items.
