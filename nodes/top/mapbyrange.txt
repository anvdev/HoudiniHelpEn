= Map by Range =

"""Map upstream work items to downstream work items using range values"""

Maps a range of upstream items to a range of downstream items. The range is
determined by two main properties: the ratio of upstream work items to
downstream work items, and an offset in the left and right direction.

For example, with __Upstream Range__ set to 2 and __Downstream Range__ set to 1,
two upstream items will be mapped to each downstream item.

@parameters

[Include:mapper_common#pdg_dynamicmap]

Upstream Range:
    #id: upstreamrange

    Along with the __Downstream Range__ parameter, determines the ratio between
    upstream and downstream work items.

Downstream Range:
    #id: downstreamrange

    Determines the number of downstream work items for each group of upstream
    work items specified in the __Upstream Range__ parameter.

Left Offset:
    #id: leftoffset

    The number of additional items proceeding the selected items that should
    also be mapped to the downstream items.

Right Offset:
    #id: rightoffset

    The number of additional items that follow the selected items that should
    also be mapped to the downstream items.
