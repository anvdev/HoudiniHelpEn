= Shotgun Session =

"""Start a session to connect to a Shotgun instance."""

This node needs to be a parent node for all other Shotgun nodes, and sets up a
connection to Shotgun for all of the other Shotgun nodes to use. It acts
similarly to the command chain nodes.

== Setup == (stick)
Some minimal setup is required for using Shotgun. To use Shotgun, you must have
a Shotgun account on an active Shotgun instance and know your credentials. At
this time, only username and password login is supported. You must also have the Shotgun
Python API on your Houdini Python path.

Set the environment variables `PDG_SHOTGUN_LOGIN` to your Shotgun username and
`PDG_SHOTGUN_PASSWORD` to your Shotgun password.

This node requires the [Shotgun Python API|https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/python-api].

@parameters

== Node ==

Shotgun URL:
    #id: shotgunurl

    The URL at which you access your Shotgun instance.
== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that should only be changed if the defaults don't
work.

Use Custom Port:
    #id: customport

    Enable the custom port for the internal Shotgun Session server.
Command Port:
    #id: serverport

    The Shotgun Session node starts a server under the hood to coordinate
    communication between all of the Shotgun nodes and Shotgun itself. Specify
    a custom port here for that server, in case of firewall restrictions or
    similar.
