= Split =

"""Splits upstream items in two"""

This node uses an expression to split upstream work items into two groups. The
work items that match the condition are pass to the left input and the items
that don't are passed on the right.

@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Split Expression:
    #id: splitexpression

    This parameter is evaluated for each upstream work item to determine which
    output the item should appear on. If the expression returns a non-zero
    value the work item will appear on the left output, otherwise it will 
    appear on the right output.

Invert Selection:
    #id: indexvalue

    Inverts the behavior of the node. Work items that match the __Split
    Expression__ will appear on the right output, and work items that fail to
    match will appear on the left.
