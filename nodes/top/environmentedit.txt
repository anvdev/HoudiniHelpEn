"""Edits the variables set in the environment work item command lines execute in."""


== Overview ==

Each work item keeps a list of environment variables that should be set in the environment the work item's command line runs in. These are stored as work item attributes with a `$` prefix on the name (for example, `$REPO_DIR`).

The list of variables gets passed down from parent to child items down through the network. This node lets you edit the environment variable list of the work items passing through the node.


@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Reset Environment:
    #id: reset

    Clears the incoming list of environment variables (don't inherit the list of variables set on the upstream items).

Add Variables:
    #id: environment

    Use this multiparm to set up the environment variables to add/set in the outgoing work items.

Variable Name:
    #id: varname

    The name of the variable to set, not including the `$` prefix.

Variable Type:
    #id: vartype

    The data type of the value. Note that this is only used internally for the work item. In the execution environment, all environment variables are just strings.

Value:
    The value to set the variable to.
