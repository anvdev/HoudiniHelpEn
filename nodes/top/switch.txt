= Switch =

"""Switch which between network branches"""

This node can be used to switch between input network branches based on the
__Select Input__ parameter. The node network will behave as if the selected
input branch is wired directly into the node on the switch's output.

This node does not generate any work items.

@parameters

Select Input:
    #id: input

    Selects which input branch is active. Other branches will not be evaluated
    when cooking the TOP graph.
