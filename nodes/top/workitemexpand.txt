= Work Item Expand =

"""Expands file lists or partitions into multiple work items"""

This node can be used to expand ether an upstream item's output file list or a
partition into multiple work items. Example use cases:

A work item has 30 output files associated with it, and you'd like to create a
new work item for each of those 30 files.

A partition has some number of work items in it, and you'd like to create a
new work item for each group of 5 items in the partition.

@top_attributes

::`expandsize`:
    #type: integer

    The size of the expanded group of work items. For example  if __Expansion Type__
    is set to a __Fixed Count__ of 3 and there are 12 items in the partition being
    expanded, `expandsize` will be set to 4 on each work item. If there were only
    11 items in the partition, then the last set of work items would have an
    `expandsize` of 2.

@parameters

[Include:processor_common#pdg_workitemgeneration]

Apply Expansion To:
    #id: expand

    Determines what will be expanded.

    Upstream Output Files:
	For each upstream work item, expands the output files into more work
	items.

    Items in Upstream Partitions:
	For each upstream partition, expands the items in the partition into
	more work items.

Expansion Type:
    #id: expansiontype

    Determines the relationship between the elements being expanded and the
    new work items.

    One to One:
	A new work item will be created for each upstream file or for each work
	item in the upstream partition.

    Fixed Size:
	The upstream files or partitioned items will be put into fixed size
	groups based on __Value__, a new work item will be created for each
	of those groups.
	
    Fixed Count:
	The upstream files or partitioned items will be distributed amongst a
	fixed number of groups based on __Value__, a new work item will be
	created for each of those groups.

Value:
    #id: value

    When using an expansion type other than __One to One__, this parameter
    determines the way the upstream elements are grouped.
