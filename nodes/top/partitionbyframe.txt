= Partition by Frame =

"""Partitions work items based on their frame"""

Partitions work items based on their frame and the selected frame rounding mode.
This node can be used to combine multiple subframes into a single frame unit, or 
to separate frames from different wedge variations.

@parameters

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_dynamicpartition]

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Frame ==

Frame Rounding:
    #id: framerounding
    
    Determines how the frame is converted to an integer for partitioning, used
    when partioning work items with fractional frames.

    Round Down:
	Rounds the frame down to the nearest integer. For example, values from
	1.0 to 1.9 will be treated as frame 1.

    Round Up:
	Rounds the frame up to the nearest integer. For example, values from
	1.1 to 2.0 will be treated as frame 2.

    Round Nearest:
	Rounds to the nearest frame. For example, values from 1.0 to 1.49 are
	treated as frame 1.0, and values from 1.5 to 2.0 are treat as frame 2.

Wedge Attribute:
    #id: wedgeattribute

    When this parameter is enabled, it specifies an attribute to look up on the
    work items to determine which wedge they're associated with. This used to
    keep work items from different wedges in separate partitions.

Ignore Items With No Frame:
    #id: ignoremissing

    When this toggle is enabled, work items with no frame value will be ignored.
    Otherwise, an error will be reported when trying to partition a work item
    without a frame value specified.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
