= Partition by Index =

"""Partitions work items based on their index"""

This node partitions work items based on their index value, or using a
custom indexing scheme.

@parameters

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_dynamicpartition]

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Index ==

Primary Input Rule:
    #id: primary rule

    Determines how the work items from the node on the first/primary input
    are partitioned.

    All:
	Each upstream item from the primary input is put into all partitions.

    By Index:
	Each upstream item from the primary input is put into a partition
	based on its index.

    None:
	Upstream items from the primary input aren't put into any of the
	partitions.

Secondary Input Rule:
    #id: secondaryinputrule

    Determines how the work items from the unordered secondary input
    are partitioned.

    All:
	Each upstream item from the secondary input is put into all partitions.

    By Index:
	Each upstream item from the secondary input is put into a partition
	based on its index.

    Primary Intersection:
	Each upstream item from the secondary input is put into a partition
	based on its index, provided that there is an item from the primary
	input with the same index.

    None:
	Upstream items from the secondary input aren't put into any of the
	partitions.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
