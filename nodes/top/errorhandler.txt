"""Error handler for failed work items."""

If this node exists in the network, it will output copies of any "failed" work items from elsewhere in the network.

This lets you set up a separate, disconnected part of the TOP network that processes failed items. For example, you could set up a node chain that sends a notification with a list of input files that caused errors.

TIP:
    This node only generates copies of _work items_ that are marked failed. This node does nothing if an entire node errors trying to cook.
