"""Execute Perforce commands through PDG"""

This node acts as a wrapper around Perforce functionality. It provides an
interface for executing <i>p4</i> commands.

@installation

In order to use this node, you must ensure that Perforce is installed on any
systems where jobs for this node are going to run.

In addition, the Perforce node must be able to find the <i>p4</i> executable.
When the job runs, it will first look for an environment variable called
<b>PDG_PERFORCE</b>. If this variable is defined, the job will use its value as
the path to Perforce's executable. If the <b>PDG_PERFORCE</b> environment
variable is not defined, the node will assume that <i>p4</i> is available via
the system's path.

@top_attributes

::`perforceop`
    #type: string

    Indicates the Perforce operation to perform (update, sync, edit, submit,
    add, change, or test)

::`overridebin`
    #type: integer

    Specifies whether the user has overriden the default behaviour for
    determining the location of the P4 executable. When this is set to 1, the
    work script will use the custom binary path specified by the user.

::`perforcebin`
    #type: string

    This is set to the custom P4 executable path specified by the user. This is
    used as the path to the P4 executable when `overridebin` is set to 1

::`usefilepattern`
    #type: integer

    For the `update`, `sync`, `edit`, and `add` operations: when this is 1, the
    work script will use the file pattern specified by `filepattern` in the P4
    command rather than the list of inputs tagged as 'file'

::`filepattern`
    #type: string

    For the `update`, `sync`, `edit`, and `add` operations: when
    `usefilepattern` is set to 1, the work script will use this file pattern in
    the P4 command rather than the list of inputs tagged as 'file'

::`changelistnum`
    #type: integer

    For the `edit`, `submit`, and `add` operations: specifies the changelist
    number for the operation

::`changelistchoice`
    #type: string

    Specifies whether the default changelist or a numbered changelist is being
    used.

::`changelistdescription`
    #type: string

    For the `submit` and `change` operations: specifies the changelist
    description

::`p4configfile`
    #type: string

    Specifies the location of the P4 config file

::`forcesync`
    #type: integer

    For the `sync` operation: indicates whether a force sync should be performed

@parameters

== Node ==

=== Operation ===

Perforce Operation:
    #id: perforceop

    This menu is used to select the Perforce command that will be executed.

Use File Pattern:
    #id: filepattern

    For Perforce commands that require file inputs, this parameter can be used
    to specify a file pattern. If the file pattern parameter is disabled, there
    <b>must</b> be results on the upstream work item tagged as 'file'. The node
    will use those results tagged as 'file' as the input files to the Perforce
    command.

Force Sync:
    #id: forcesync

    If performing the sync command, this will enable or disable a force sync.

Changelist:
    #id: changelistchoice

    If the Perforce command involves a changelist, this provides the choice of
    using the default changelist or of using a numbered changelist.

Changelist Number:
    #id: changelistnum

    If the Perforce command involves a changelist and the changelist option is
    set to 'Numbered', this allows for the changelist number to be specified.

Description:
    #id: changelistdescription

    This parameter is used to create the description for any Perforce commands
    that require a changelist description.

=== Common ===

P4 Config File:
    #id: p4configfile

    Specifies the location of a P4 Config file. This will cause the
    <b>P4CONFIG</b> environment variable to be set in the job's environment.

Override Perforce Path:
    #id: perforcebin

    This allows the path to the <i>p4</i> executable to be completely
    overwritten with a custom path.
