= Partition by Comparison =

"""Partitions work items using existing comparisons"""

This node creates a partition for each work item on the primary input. Any
work items on the secondary input that successfully compare against items on the
primary input are put into the partition(s) for those primary work items. The
comparison values used to determine whether or not a primary and secondary work
match are looked up from attributes on work items on the third input.

The configuration of this node makes it possible to do the work of comparing 
work items as actual jobs, since the comparison information is passed in as a
third stream of work items.

Pair Attribute:
    #id: comparepairname

Result Attribute:
    #id: resultname

    The name of the attribute on the comparison work items that indicates
    whether that comparison was successful or not.
