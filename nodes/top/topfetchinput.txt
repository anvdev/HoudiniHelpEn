This node can be used to receive input data from a [TOP Fetch|Node:top/topfetch]
node in a different network. The TOP Fetch node in the original network will
write its attributes and input file list to JSON file. The path to that file is
available in this node via the `$PDG_FETCH_JSON_FILE` environment variable.

    TOP Fetch Input will load the work item attributes and inputs from the file
    and create a copy of the work item in this node.
