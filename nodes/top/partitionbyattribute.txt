"""Partitions work items based on their attributes"""

This node provides a variety of ways to partition work items based on their
attributes.

== Attributes ==

Partition By:
    #id: mode

    Determines how to create partitions from the __Attribute__ conditions.

    Attribute Name:
	A partition is created for each distinct attribute name in the upstream
	work items. All work item that have that attribute are put into the
	partition.

	When the __Partition Attributes Independently__ toggle is off, a single
	partition is created for work items that have all of the specified
	attributes.

    Specific Attribute Values:
	The same as __Attribute Name__, but the rather than simply having the
	attribute the work items in the partition must also have a specific
	value for the attribute. The value is specified using the __Value__
	parameter in each of the conditions.

	When the __Partition Attributes Independently__ toggle is off, a single
	partition is created for work items that have all of the specified
	attribute values.

    Distinct Attribute Values:
	A partition is created for each distinct value of the specified attribute
	in the list upstream work items. For example if the distinct attribute
	is an integer, all the work items that have a value of 0 will be placed
	in the same partition, all the items with a value of 1 in a different
	partition, etc. The values do no need to begin with zero or be
	consecutive.

	When the __Partition Attributes Independently__ toggle is off, the
	values are placed into a tuple and a partition is created for each
	unique tuple.

Sort Direction:
    #id: sortdirection

    Only available when __Partition By__ is set to __Distinct Attribute Values__,. Determines if partition are indexed in ascending or descending order based on their attribute values.

Partition Attributes Independently:
    #id: independent

    Determines if the __Attribute__ conditions should be considered individually
    or as a collective, single condition.

Create Partition for Unmatched Items:
    #id: createunmatched

    When this toggle is enabled an extra partition will be created that contains
    all work items that failed to match the other __Attribute__ conditions.

Attributes:
    #id: attributes

    The number of attribute conditions.

Name:
    #id: name

    The name of the attribute.

Type:
    #id: type

    The type of the attribute, either Float, Integer, or String.

Index:
    #id: index

    This parameter determines the attribute index that the condition should
    check.

Value:
    #id: value

    When partitioning by __Specific Attribute Value__ this parameter determines
    the attribute value that condition should check.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
