= ROP Composite Output =

"""Creates work items that cook an embedded ROP Composite node """

This node is a subnet that contains a [ROP Fetch|Node:top/ropfetch] TOP node and
a ROP Network with a [ROP Composite|Node:out/comp]. The parameters on the ROP
Composite node are promoted onto this node's interface.

The subnet also contains a built in COP network. By default the ROP Composite
is configured to use that COP network. When the __Use External COP__ option
is enabled the ROP Composite can instead be used with any COP network in the
.hip file.
