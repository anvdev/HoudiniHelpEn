"""Copies a file from one location to another, either at runtime or whenever the node generates."""

The node sets the destination file path(s) as the result file of this node's work item.

    #type: string

    The destination folder where files will be copied to.

::`resultdatatag`
    #type: string

    The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to use for the copied file(s).

::`copyto`

    upstream result files.

@parameters

Copy File(s) During:
    #id: copyduring

    When to copy the files:

    Generate:
	The file(s) will be copied during the work item generation stage. When this is on, the file is copied whenever the node generates static items (when the network starts cooking, or when you explicitly ask to generate static items). Only turn this on if the file exists ahead of time or the node is set to dynamic work item generation.

    Cook (In-Process):
	The file(s) will be copied during the cook and within the graph cooking process. This will usually be preferred to cooking out of process unless the file size is very large.

    Cook (Out-of-Process):
	The file(s) will be copied during the cook and within their own process. This mode is usually best for copying large files in another process so that it doesn't hold up cooking the rest of the network.

~~~~ Source ~~~~

File Source:
    #id: filesource

    Specifies the source for the file(s) to be copied:

    Upstream Result File:
	Get the file path(s) from the incoming work item's `output` attribute and copy any files that have a tag matching the `Result Tag` parameter. This allows multiple files to be copied at once.

    Custom File Path:
	Copy the file specified by the `File Path` parameter.

Result Tag:
    #id: filetag

    When the file source is upstream result files, this specifies the tag of the result files that should be copied.

File Path:
    #id: filepath

    When the file source is a custom file path, this specifies the filepath of that file.

~~~~ Destination ~~~~

Copy To:
    #id: copyto

    Specifies where the files will be copied to:

    Directory:
	The file(s) will be copied to the directory specified by the `Directory` parameter. This option should be used when copying multiple files.

    File:
	The file will be copied to the directory specified by the `File Path` parameter. This option should be avoided when copying multiple files, or each file copy will overwrite the previous copy.

Directory:
    #id: destfolder

    The directory that the source file(s) will be copied to when copying to a directory.

File Path:
    #id: destfile

    The filepath that the source file will be copied to when copying to a file path.

Result Data Tag:
    #id: resultdatatag

    This node sets the destination path as the "file result" of its work item. The [file tag|/tops/filetags] to use for the result. The default is just `file`. You may want to specialize the tag based on the type of file being copied (for example, `file/image/exr` or `file/geo`).
