"""Sorts work items by a list of attributes"""

This node reorders input work items based on one more attribute values. The 
attributes are used to create a tuple that identifies the work item and
determines its new index. The ordering of values in the __Attributes to Sort By__ 
multiparm determine the order that attributes are inserted into the tuple.

For example, consider 3 work item with the `buildingnum` and `floornum`
attributes. The first two work items both have `buildingnum = 2`, and `floornum = 0`
and `floornum = 1` respectively. The third work item has `buildingnum = 0` and
`floornum = 0`. By specifying "buildingnum" as the first attribute to sort by
and "floornum" as the second, the items would would be sorted in the order they
were originally in. If "floornum" was put first and "buildingnum" second,
the items would be reorder so that the new order is 3, 1, 2 instead.
