= Partition by Node =

"""Partitions work items based on their node"""

This node partitions work items based on the input nodes. 

@parameters

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_dynamicpartition]

[Include:partitioner_common#pdg_partitionmerge]

== Node ==

Partition For Each:
    #id: partition type

    Determines how the input work items should be partitioned.

    Input Node:
	A partition is created for each input node, and all work items from
	that node are put into the partition.

    Input Work Item Tuple:
	A partition is created for each tuple of input work items. The first
	work item from each node goes into the first partition, the second work
	item from each node goes into the second partition, etc.

    Input Work Item Combination:
	A partition is created for each unique combination of input work items. 

Custom Sort Key:
    #id: sortkey

    When this parameter is enabled, a custom sort key can be specified as 
    an expression. By default input work items are sorted based on their index.
    Work items from each node are sorted as a group prior to being partitioned.
    
    The sort key is not used when __Partition For Each__ is set to __Input
    Node__, since all work items from a given node will go into the same
    partition

Partial Partitions:
    #id: partialpartitions

    This toggle is only available when using the __Input Work Item Tuple__ 
    partition option. When this toggle is enabled it becomes possible for a
    partition to not have an item for each input node. This can occur when
    input nodes have a different number of work items.

    For example if the first input has 2 work items and the other has 4 work
    items, a total of 4 partitions will be created when this toggle is enabled.
    The first two will have two items in them: item 1 and item 2 the input
    nodes, respectively. The remaining two partitions will only have 1 work
    item each.

== Advanced ==

These are advanced parameters that provide finer control over the behavior of
the partitioner.
