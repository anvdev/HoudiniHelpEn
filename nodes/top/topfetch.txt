"""Cooks another TOP network"""

This node can be used to cook a different TOP network. The other network can
exist in the same .hip file or an external file, and will be cooked via the
active scheduler. The other TOP network is evaluated in a separate process from
the current one.

This node works in two steps.  First work items are generated to cook the external
TOP network referred to by the __TOP Path__ parameter.  The attributes and input
files associated with each work in this node are made accessible to the fetched
network using the standard work item JSON format. The path to the JSON file is
exported as `$PDG_FETCH_JSON_FILE` in the environment used to cook the fetched
network. The fetched network can use a [TOP Fetch Input|Node:top/topfetchinput]
node to load that work item into its own network.

When the remote TOP network is cooked, the work items on the output node of that
network are saved to disk and reported back to PDG.  Then these items are re-created
in the topfetch node.  The items visible on the topfetch node are those re-created
items.
