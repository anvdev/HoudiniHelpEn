"""Cooks another TOP network"""

This node can be used to cook a different TOP network. The other network can 
exist in the same .hip file or an external file, and will be cooked via the
active scheduler. The other TOP network is evaluated in a separate process from
the current one.

Each work item in this node represents a request to cook the external TOP
network referred to by the __TOP Path__ parameter. The attributes and input
files associated with each work in this node are made accessible to the fetched
network using the standard work item JSON format. The path to the JSON file is
exported as `$PDG_FETCH_JSON_FILE` in the environment used to cook the fetched
network. The fetched network can use a [TOP Fetch Input|Node:top/topfetchinput]
node to load that work item into its own network.

@parameters
