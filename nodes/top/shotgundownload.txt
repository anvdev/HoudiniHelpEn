= Shotgun Download =

"""Download an attachment from Shotgun."""

This node can be used in one of two ways. The first way involves specifying an
attachment ID directly and downloading it. In this mode, the filename cannot be
automatically determined. Otherwise, you can use a Shotgun Find node to search
for an entity that has an attachment in one of its fields. The field containing
the attachment must be specified in the Shotgun Find node as well as the
Shotgun Download node.
