== Starting a new rig setup ==

:task: Create a new setup:
    Set a character rig to the scene by selecting that character with [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node]. 
    
    Alternatively, the node name can be typed into the character text field, or dragged in from the Network Editor. A history of the selected characters is maintained in the drop down menu next to the character text field.
        
:task: Turn on edit mode:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit button in the menu bar.
    
    TIP:

    # Click the __[Icon:BUTTONS/plus] button beside an existing tab, select __New Tab Type__, and select either __Single View__ or __Multi View__. A __Single View__ will contain one character viewer pane, while a __Multi View__ will contain four panes that can be resized.

    # Make sure [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is on.

    # Click [Icon:BUTTONS/plus] in the current view.
    
    # Click the spot in the Character Picker pane where you'd like to place your new button. 
    
:task: Add a new control button at the center of the pane:

    # Click [Icon:BUTTONS/plus] in the current view.
    
    # Press ((Enter)).
    
    Alternatively, you can hold ((Ctrl)) and click [Icon:BUTTONS/plus] in the Character picker pane.

:task: Stop adding a new button:
    If you have clicked the [Icon:BUTTONS/plus] button to add a new button and want to cancel this process, press ((Esc)).
    
:task: Reposition the control button:
    Click and drag the control when [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is turned on.

:task: Link the button to a control:
    # Make sure [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is on.
    
    # Right-click the control and select __Edit Target Nodes__.
    
    # Select the controls you want to link and click __Accept__.
    
:task: Set/reset the target nodes of a button:
    
    # Select the desired nodes in the viewport. 
    
    # Right-click the control in the Character Picker pane and select __Set from Viewport Selection__.
    
:task: Add another target node to a button:

:task: Select mirrored control buttons:
    Hold ((Shift + Alt)) and click when [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] is on.
    
    NOTE:
        To be mirror button pairs, the buttons must have the same node contents. This means the nodes they contain can only differ in name by the suffixes `left` and `right`, and the number of nodes they contain must be the same.
        
:task: Change the color of a control.
    # Make sure [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is on.
    
    # Right-click the control you want to removed and select __Edit Color__.

:task: Remove a control:
    # Make sure [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is on.
    
    # Right-click the control you want to removed and select __Delete__.

If another control button shares any nodes with the button that is currently selected, it will be highlighted, but not selected.

== Adding background images ==

You can set background images from either the current viewport, an external file, or an image supplied by a URL link.

# Make sure [Icon:BUTTONS/edit] Edit mode is on.

# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] the gear menu and select __Set Background__.

# Choose either __From Viewport__, __From File__, or __From URL__.

The images will be saved within the character picker, so there is no need to keep image files or maintain directory continuity.

NOTE:
    A __Scene View__ tab must be visible for the background to be set with a viewport image. Additionally, the `.hip` must be saved and have an associated `$HIP` directory.

== Working with multiple characters in a scene ==

If you have multiple characters in the scene with identical rigs and wish to use the same layout controls to manipulate both, select the other characters using the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser. You can toggle between the characters using the dropdown menu. Whichever character is displayed in the __Characters__ field is the character the controls will be applied to.

== Loading and Saving ==

Views can be saved to a `.json` file or directly to the rig's digital asset. For example, the [Simple Biped|Node:obj/simplebiped] character already includes a character picker rig. The view state is stored by using the __File > Save Layout__ menu. Views can be loaded from a digital asset or an external file via __File > Load Layout__, dragging and dropping its node from the Network Editor into the Character Picker panel or __Character__ text field, or by clicking [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] and selecting your node. 

TIP:
    Press ((Ctrl + S)) to quick save changes to the place the layout was last saved or originally loaded from.

NOTE:
    Only HDA Object nodes can be loaded.
