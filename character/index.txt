"""How to rig and animate characters in Houdini."""

Character setup and animation involves three stages: rigging, animation, and finaling.

In Houdini, you usually separate the responsibilities
of technical setup of a character
and the creative animation process
with [digital assets|/assets/].

The technical director can encapsulate characters as
digital assets so to the animators the character becomes just like any
other Houdini tool, with its own interface.

This lets the TD promote handles and parameter controls to the asset's
interface for use by animators, and the animator can use this high-level
interface while the TD or rigger continues to refine the rigging,
capturing, and facial setup.

As new versions of the character are completed, you can seamlessly
update the asset to make the latest controls available to the animators.
You can also use this technique to animate with lo-fi characters and
swap in hi-fi characters at render time.
