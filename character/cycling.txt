= Cycling Animation =

There are several ways to cycle animation in Houdini. For this example we will explain how to cycle the first 25 keyframes through the remaining 125.

== Channel Before/After extrapolation ==

The simplest way to cycle animation is to set the Before and After Extrapolation to Cycle or CycleOffset.

# Add the channels that you want to cycle to the [Channel List|/ref/panes/chanlist].
# Click ((RMB)) on the left column showing the selected parameter labels in the [Channel List.|/ref/panes/chanlist]
# Select __Channels__ > __Extrapolation__  and change the extrapolation mode to  __Cycle__ or __Cycle Offset__.

== Expressions ==

One way to do this is by using the `cycle()` or `cycleoffset()` expression in the [Animation Editor|/ref/panes/animeditor].

# Add the parameters that you want to cycle to the [Channel List|/ref/panes/chanlist].
# Set a keyframe at frame 125 in the [Icon:CHANNELS/view_graph][Graph view|/ref/panes/changraph] of the Animation Editor.
# Select the channel segments from frame 25 to 125.
# In the __Function__ menu, choose `cycle()` or `cycleoffset()`. 

TIP:
    `cycle()` will continue from the starting value of your channels.

== Dopesheet ==

If you want to create actual keyframes for the cycle, use the [Dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet] in the [Animation Editor|/ref/panes/animeditor].

# Add the parameters that you want to cycle to the [Animation Editor|/ref/panes/animeditor].
# Switch to the [Icon:CHANNELS/view_dopesheet][Dopesheet view|/ref/panes/dopesheet].
# Select frames 1 to 25 (inclusive) in the __All Displayed Channels__ row.
# In the __Edit__ menu, choose __Copy__.
# Select frames 26 to 125 (inclusive) in the __All Displayed Channels__ row.
# In the __Edit__ menu, choose __Paste Special > Cycle__ (or __Repeat__).

== Motion Effects ==

For more procedural cycling of animation than the `cycle()` or `cycleoffset()` expressions, you can use [Motion Effects|/network/motioneffects].

# Add the channels that you want to cycle to the [Channel List|/ref/panes/chanlist].
# Click ((RMB)) the [playbar|/anim/playbar] and choose __Motion Effects > Cycle__.

NOTE:
    In the [Extend CHOP|Node:chop/extend] parameter window that pops up, you can change the __Right Behavior__ from __Cycle__ to __Repeat__ if you want to repeat the animation instead.
