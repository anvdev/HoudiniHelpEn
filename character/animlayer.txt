    #id: 116796990

The Animation Layer pane is used when you already have animation, and want to make changes to it. You can create a base layer of the primary animation, and then create additional layers to make changes to the existing animation. The base layer is a layer of all the channels of the character. Each additional layer is a copy of the base layer animation, with zero values.

For example, say you want to animate a character running through the forest and ducking under a fallen log. You can have animation of the character running as the base layer, then create an additional layer animating the character bending over. Once you have these two layers, you can adjust the __Weight__ of each layer during the animation to determine when the character should duck.
        
You can also use this tool as a way to fix animation. For example, if you have an animation of a character running on the ground, but at certain points his feet go through the ground geometry. You can create a layer to raise the feet up without having to redo all of the running animation.

== How it works ==

When you create a base layer in the Animation Layer pane, a CHOP network with two CHOPS are also created. The first is the `layer_mixer_base` ([Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel]) and the second is the `layer_mixer`([Layer CHOP|Node:chop/layer]), which will compute the blending of the layers. The base layer will hold the default pose or default animation.

Creating additional layers will create copies of the base layer, with the same channels. Any changes you make are stored on the active layer, which is the highlighted layer in the Animation Layer pane.

NOTE:
    You must use the Animation Layer pane to add new layers. Do not try to add new layers using CHOPs because it won't be reflected properly in the layers.

The [Export Flag|/nodes/chop] will override what is on the object.

== Animation Layer Buttons ==

[Icon:BUTTONS/unpinned] Pin:
    Turning on the pin will keep the layer visible when you click away from it. This is useful for adding other objects to an existing layer mixer
        
[Icon:BUTTONS/layer_solo_off] Solo:
    Enabling this option will only show the animation for this specific layer. It will make the layer contribution for all other layers 0.
        
[Icon:BUTTONS/layer_mute] Mute:
    Enabling this option will turn off the animation for this specific layer. It will make the layer contribution for this layer 0.

:task:Display Animation Layer Mixer:
    In the __Animation Editor__ click  [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu > __View__ > __Show Layers__.

:task:Create base layer:
    Once you have animated your objects, click the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu and select __Create Layer Mixer from Channel List__.
                
:task:Add a new layer:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu and select __Add Layer to Layer Mixer__. 
    
    NOTE:
        Do not try to add new layers using CHOPs because it won't be reflected properly in the layers.
        
:task:Switch the active layer:
    Select the layer you want to become the active layer in the Animation Layer pane. Once it is highlighted, it becomes the active layer.

:task:Rename or delete a layer:
    Click ((RMB)) on the layer and select __Rename Layer__ or __Delete Layer__.
    
    NOTE:
        Do not try to delete layers using CHOPs because it won't be reflected properly in the layers.

:task:Change the weight of the layer:
    Change the value in the Animation Layer Mixer, or drag the __Weight__ slider on the `layer_mixer` CHOP.

:task:Merge layers:
    Click ((RMB)) the layer you want to merge, and select __Merge Down Layer__. This will merge the layer with the one below it. This is useful to do when you are satisfied with your animation corrections and want to merge it into the base layer.
    
    TIP:
        You can change the order of the layers by clicking ((RMB)) and selecting either __Move Layer Up__ or __Move Layer Down__. 

:task:See all channels in one graph:
    Use the Motion FX View. 
        
    NOTE:
        You must turn on __Use Full Animation Range__ on the [Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel] to display all channels at once.

:task:Use motion blur:
    You can increase or decrease the __Sample Rate__ parameter on the [Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel]. A higher value will create smooth motion blur, whereas a lower value will create more blocky animation.

== Notes ==

* Do not make changes to the hierarchy of the CHOP nodes.

* You must use the Animation Layer pane to add and delete layers. Do not try to add or delete layers using CHOPs because it won't be reflected properly in the layers.
