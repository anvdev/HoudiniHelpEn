== Capture geometry by proximity ==

To bind surfaces to bones, you specify a 3D volume around the bone,
inside which the bone will "capture" surfaces. You will control the
capture regions using manipulators that define the volume in which the
capturing will occur.

TIP:
    The skeleton and skin surfaces should overlap in 3D.  Switch to the
    capture pose if you need to use a specific pose
    for capturing geometry.

:task:Bind geometry to bones:
    # Click the [Capture
      Geometry tool|/shelf/capturegeometry] on the __Characters__ shelf.

    # Select the surfaces you want to capture and press ((Enter)).

    # Select the root object of the character/bone chain you want to
      bind the geometry to and press ((Enter)).

      In shaded mode, the geometry changes to the color of its
      capturing bone. Geometry that is not captured is white.

    # If part of a surface is mistakenly captured or not captured,
      edit the capture region of the bones (see below).

    # Once the surfaces are successfully captured, you can use the
      [Pose tool|/shelf/pose] to pose the skeleton and the
      surfaces should deform to follow the skeleton.

:task:Edit the capture region of bones:
    # Click the [Edit Capture
      Regions tool|/shelf/editcaptureregions] on the __Characters__ shelf.

    # Select the bones you want to capture geometry for, then press
      ((Enter)) to confirm the selection.

    # Manipulators appear on the bones showing each bone's capture
      region (the volume around the bone which inside which geometry
      will be bound to the bone). Drag the handles to change the
      size of the capture region. Hold ((Shift)) and drag a capture
      region handle to edit all the handles on a bone at once.

=== Behind the scenes ===

    If you  [go into|/ref/panes/network]  the Geometry object containing the
    captured surfaces, you will see Houdini has added a Capture node and
    a Deform node to the existing chain. These nodes use the bone
    movements to deform the geometry.
