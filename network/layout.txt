TIP:
    When you place a node, existing nodes will automatically move out of the way to preserve spacing.


== Grid ==

:task: Show the grid:
    In the network editor, open the __Tools__ menu (at the top of the network editor pane) and click __Grid points__ or __Grid lines__.

:task: Snap to the grid:
    In the network editor, choose __Tools > Snap to grid__.

:task: Set the grid spacing:
    # Choose __View > Display options__ in the network editor to open the [display options window|options].
    
    # Click the __General__ tab and set the grid spacing.


== Laying out nodes ==

Layout Mode:
    #action: layout_mode

    Hold this key and swipe nodes with the mouse to layout or align

:col:
    * When you place a node, existing nodes will automatically move out of the way to preserve spacing.

    * The network editor shows alignment guides when you place or drag a node.

    * If you have nodes selected, the layout commands only affect the selected nodes. You can use this, for example, to select and layout only the immediate children of a node rather than all descendents.

:task: Lay out upstream from a node:
    Hold ((A)) and drag up from the node (or left to align to the left).
    
    ~~~ or ~~~
    
    Select the node and choose __Layout > Layout nodes up__ or __Layout nodes left__.
    
:task: Lay out downstream from a node:
    Hold ((A)) and drag down from the node (or right to align to the right).
    
    ~~~ or ~~~
    
    Select the node and choose __Layout > Layout nodes down__ or __Layout nodes right__.

:task: Lay out all nodes:
    In the network editor, choose __Layout > Layout all nodes__. To layout only the selected nodes, choose __Layout > Layout selected nodes__.
    
    Note that targeting automatic layout on individual nodes/branches using the ((A)) key will often give better results than doing a full re-layout, which can radically change the relative positions of nodes.


== Spacing and aligning nodes ==

The layout functions (see above) are often more convenient and give better results than manually aligning nodes, but you can use the manual tools in the __Layout__ menu to manually align nodes.

:col:
    * To align nodes with each other, select the nodes you want to align, then choose __Layout > Align nodes horizontally__ or __Align nodes vertically__.
    
        To align to a specific node, select the nodes you want to align, then hold ((Shift + A)) and drag horizontally or vertically from the node you want to align to.

:col:
    * To space out nodes evenly, select the nodes you want to move, then choose __Layout > Distribute nodes horizontally__ or __Distribute nodes vertically__.

        To keep a specific node in the same place and distribute the other nodes around it, hold ((Alt + A)) and drag horizontally or vertically from the node you want to distribute around.

* You can align and distribute at the same time by holding ((Shift + Alt + A)) and dragging.
