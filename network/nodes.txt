See [navigating networks|navigate].


== Adding nodes == (add)

:task: Create a new node:
    # In the network editor, press ((Tab)) to open a menu of available node types.
    
    # Start typing the name of a node and press ((Enter)), or use the menu items to select a node type.

    # Click in the network editor to place the new node.

    TIP:
        You can drop the node on a [wire|wire] to automatically insert it between the wire's input and output.

:task: Create a new node attached to an existing input/output:
    #id: branch_wire
    
    * Press ((RMB)) or ((MMB)) on an input or output connector, then use the menu to choose which type of node to create and press ((Enter)).
    
        If you press ((RMB)), the new node will be _inserted_ before any node already connected. If you press ((MMB)) (on an output), the new node will be _branched_ off on new wire.

    * You can also start a new wire from an input or output and then press ((Tab)) to create a node at the end of the wire.
    
    * You can press ((Tab)), choose the node type, and then while placing the node, you can drag from a connector to wire the node and place it at the same time.

    * You can press ((Tab)), choose the node type, and then press ((Shift + Enter)) to automatically wire the new node into the output of the "current" node (the node shown in the parameter editor, usually the most-recently selected node).

:task: Create a quick copy of a node:
    Hold ((Alt)) and drag the node to drag out a copy.


== Working with nodes ==

:task: Select a node:
    * Click the "body" of the node (not including the [flags|flags]).
    
    * You can hold [S|Key:h.pane.wsheet.select_mode] to enter a "select-only" mode. While you hold the key down, clicking and dragging will only select. This makes it easy to select nodes without worrying about moving the node or accidentally clicking wires, flags, or other UI.

:task: Connect nodes together:
    See [wiring nodes|wire].

:task: Delete a node:
    Select the node and choose __Edit > Delete__ or press ((Del)).

    When you delete a node, the network tries to fix itself by connecting all the descendants of the deleted node to the node's first parent.

:task: Move a node:
    * Drag the node.
        
    * To move the node and all downstream nodes at the same time, hold ((Shift)) and drag.
    
    * To move the node and all upstream nodes at the same time, hold ((Ctrl)) and drag. 

:task: Cut, copy, and paste one or more nodes:
    * Select the nodes.
        
    * Right-click a selected node and choose __Cut__, __Copy__, or __Paste__.
    
        ~~~ or ~~~
        
    * Use the __Edit__ menu or use the standard hotkeys.
      
    See also [copies and references|copying].

:task: Show a context menu of commands related to a node:
    * Press ((RMB)) on the node.

    * You can also press ((RMB)) on the name of a node in the path shown at the top of a pane to get that node's context menu.

:task: Rename a node:
    Click the name next to the node to make it editable.
	
	(See [renaming nodes|rename] for how to rename multiple nodes at once using search-and-replace.)

:task: Delete nodes:
    Select the nodes and press ((Del)).

:task: Display detailed information about a node:
    See [node info window|#info] below.


== Node ring == (ring)

Hovering over a node pops up a "ring" around the node with access to the node's [flags|flags] and a button to open the [node info window|#info]. This makes it easy to interact with flags when you're zoomed out so far the flag indicators on the node are too tiny to click.

Clicking the flags in the ring is the same as clicking the flag areas on the node. For example, you can use the same keyboard modifiers to separate the [display and render|flags#sop] flags in a geometry network.

TIP:
    Hold CTRL to temporarily fade the ring when you want to point to a node the ring is obscuring.

You can turn off the node ring or change the zoom level at which it appears in the [network editor options|options].


== Node info window == (info)

You can get statistics and information about a particular node in the _info window_. For example, the info window for geometry nodes shows the number of points, primitives, and vertices, as well as the groups and attributes in the node's geometry. This is often very useful for figuring out what's going on.

:task: Show the info window temporarily to quickly check some information:
    Hold ((MMB)) on the node. When you release the mouse button, the window automatically closes.

:task: Open a transitory window that closes when it loses focus:
    * Hover over the node and click the +(fa-info-circle) button in the ring.
    
        ~~~ or ~~~
    
    * ((Ctrl + MMB)) click the node.
    
        ~~~ or ~~~
    
    * Right-click the node and choose __Show node information__.
    
    As soon as the info window loses focus (for example, you click somewhere outside the window), it closes. This lets you check the information and interact with the controls in the window while not distracting too much.
    
    :platform:Linux:
        On Linux, the default is for the info window to persist even if it loses focus, requiring you to close the window manually. This is because some Linux users turn on a "focus follows mouse" preference, making the info window lose focus immediately and close. If you don't have "focus follows mouse" on in your window manager, you can turn on

:task: Keep the info window open persistently:
    Click the [Icon:NETVIEW/pin_out] pin icon in the info window. You can click the pin icon again to "unpin" and close the window.

:task: Keep the information in the window updated:
    * If you turn on the __Keep updated__ checkbox is on, the information in the window will automatically update if the network recooks. This can make playback or interactive updates slow as the info window is redrawn on every cook.
    
    * When __Keep updated__ is off, if the information in the window is potentially outdated (because the node cooked), the window turns gray and the Refresh button highlights yellow.
    
    * You can click the [Icon:NETVIEW/reload_needsupdate] Refresh button in the info window to update the information.

:task: Show any extra information in the info window:
    Click the [Icon:NETVIEW/verbose] Verbose button in the info window.
    
    Note that not all nodes or types of information have any extra information to show. Sometimes "extra information" may simply expand abbreviations, or make no change at all.

* You can set a preference so an unpinned info window always requires manually closing, instead of disappearing when it loses focus. In the main menus, choose __Edit > Preferences > Network editor__ and turn off __Node info windows close when losing focus__.

* You can use ((Shift + MMB)) to view the info window without cooking the node.


== Tips ==

* You can copy and paste between multiple running instances of Houdini. To make each running copy of Houdini have a separate clipboard, use the `SESI_COPY_SUFFIX` environment variable.
