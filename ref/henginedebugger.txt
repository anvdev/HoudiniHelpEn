= Houdini Engine Debugger =

== Overview ==

Houdini Engine Debugger is a debugging server for applications which use the Houdini Engine.  Houdini Engine allows Houdini technology to be integrated into any application. It is an API that allows Houdini digital assets to be used directly inside of the host application. 

== Usage ==

The debugger window can be summoned with __Windows > Houdini Engine Debugger__.  The window can be closed when the debugger is running.

Once the debugger is started a client application can be configured to connect to the running Houdini instance to execute HAPI calls.  Those calls will execute in the context of the Houdini instance so the results can be seen immediately and inspected like a normal Houdini scene.  The primary use of the debugger is to ease development of HAPI applications / plug-ins and digital assets used by the same. 

The SideFX Unreal, Unity and Maya Houdini Engine plug-ins have a __Session Type__ parameter which can be set to the host & port the debugger is running on.
