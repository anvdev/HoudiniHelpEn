= Add to Channel List dialog =

The Add to Channel List dialog provides some options for adding channels to the channel list from a specific node. By adding a channel to the channel list, you are making it available for viewing/editing in the timeline, [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor], and [channel list|/ref/panes/chanlist].

Include Inputs:
    Turning on this option will add all channels found on all of the nodes that are directly or indirectly wired to the input of the selected node.

Include Outputs:
    Turning on this option will add all channels found on all of the nodes that are directly or indirectly wired to the output of the selected node.
    
Include Descendants:
    Turning on this option will add all channels found on all of the nodes that are contained inside the selected node.

Include Both Constant and Animated Channels:
    Selecting this option will allow both constant and animated channels to be added. 
    
    An animated channel has values that differ across time. A constant channel has the same value across time.

Include Only Animated Channels:
    Selecting this option will only allow channels which have values that differ across time to be added.

Include Only Constant Channels:
    Selecting this option will only allow channels which have the same values across time to be added.
    
Include Only Channels with Non-Integer Keyframes:
    Turning on this option will only add channels that have keys at non-integer frames.
