= Display Options (3D viewer) =

#helpid: h.opmenu.viewdisplay

When the __Apply operations to all split views__ checkbox at the bottom of the window is on (the default), all changes in this window apply to all split viewports.

When using a split view, the easiest way to make viewport-specific changes is to use the viewport options menu in the top-right corner of the viewport. The menu contains most viewport-related settings you might want to change, such as shading mode.

[Image:/images/ui/viewport_menus_anno.png]

However, if you want to change other display options in only one viewport, move the pointer over the one of the split views and press ((N)) to make it "active" (the view's menus are drawn in yellow). Then open the display options window and turn off __Apply operations to all split views__ before making changes. 

== Markers tab == (markers)

Set display options for:
    #id: display_options_for

    This menu controls what category of geometry the options below apply to.

    Scene Geometry:
        Display options for unselected objects at the object level look like.
        
    Selected Scene Geometry:
        Display options for selected objects at the object level. By default this is the same as "Scene geometry".
        
    Ghost Scene Geometry:
        When you are at the geometry level (inside a [Geometry object|/basics/objects]), you can optionally show other objects "ghosted" (semi-transparent). This shows display options for these ghosted objects.
    
    Display Model Geometry:
        At the geometry level (inside a [Geometry object|/basics/objects]), display options for the output of the node with the display flag.

    Current Model Geometry:
        Display options for the selected geometry node's output. At the geometry level, when you select a node that doesn't have the display flag, the view shows the output of the selected node (by default, as wireframe) along with the output of the network. This lets you edit the node and see the effects in the view. 
        
    Template Model Geometry:
        Display options for "templated" geometry. You can set the [template flag|/nodes/sop/] on a geometry node to keep the node's output visible at the geometry level alongside the display geometry.

Use:
    Allows you to use the marker settings from another category for the current category. To manually set options for the current category, choose "Unique settings".

Link Toolbar:
    When this option is on, the controls on the display toolbar (to the right of the viewport) will affect the settings for the current category.
    
    For example, if you are editing the "Ghost scene geometry" markers, and you turn on __Link toolbar__, then clicking the [Icon:VIEW/display_point_numbers] Display Point Numbers button on the toolbar will turn point numbers on or off for ghost scene geometry. If you turn __Link toolbar__ off, then ghost scene geometry will always use the "Point numbers" setting from the display options, ignoring the toolbar button.

=== Marker type visibility menu === (visibility)

Most marker types have a small visibility icon menu to the right of the label that allows you specify different levels of visibility for the marker type. This can be useful for reducing clutter in the viewport. Click the icon to show a menu of visibility levels:

[Icon:VIEW/always_visible] Always visible:
   Show the markers on all visible components.
   
[Icon:VIEW/selected_visibility] Only selected components:
   Only show the markers on selected components (points, primitives, vertices).

[Icon:VIEW/local_area_visibility] Area around pointer:
   Only show the markers near the mouse pointer.
   
[Icon:VIEW/hover_visibility] Under pointer only:
   Only show the marker on the component (point, primitive, vertex) under the mouse pointer.

=== Points ===

Markers:
    Draw small dots showing the point locations. 

Numbers:
    Draw the point number next to the point location. Point numbers start at 0.

Normals:
    Draw the point normal direction as a small line from the point location. You can change the line length using the __Normal scale__ option on the __Guides__ tab.
    
    If a point does not have a normal attribute, Houdini draws a generated normal (as used by the viewport and Mantra), in a dimmer color.

UV coords:
    Draw each point's UV texture coordinates next to the point location.

XYZ coords:
    Draw each point's 3D coordinates next to the point location. Drawing three decimal numbers for each point can clutter the screen quickly, so you might want to use the [visibility menu|#visibility] for this option.

Trails:
    Draw a trail line from the current point position back to where it was in the previous frame. This information is taken from the point's `v` (velocity) vector attribute. You can scale the trail length using the __Vector scale__ option on the __Guides__ tab.

Coincident:
    Draw the number of overlapping points when multiple points overlap on the screen (for example, if three points overlap, draws a `3`).

    This is in screen space, so it's most useful when the geometry you're looking at occupies a lot of the viewer. If the geometry is small/far away, you'll get a lot of useless overlap readings.
    
    Don't turn this on for all geometry in the scene. It works best on the display geometry, or only the selected geometry.

=== Primitives ===

"Primitives" are polygon faces, curves, and NURBS surfaces (as well as more exotic types such as metaballs, primitive shapes, and crowd agents).

Hulls:
    Draw lines representing the limits of NURBS, Beziér surfaces, curves, and metaballs.

    It can be useful to display hulls in place of the actual geometry when extremely large numbers of these types of geometry fill the screen, to reduce clutter and speed up the display.

Numbers:
    Draw the primitive number next to the primitive. Primitive numbers start at 0.

Normals:
    Draw the primitive normal direction as a small line from the primitive's location (for primitives that have normals). You can change the line length using the __Normal scale__ option on the __Guides__ tab.
    
Breakpoints:
    Draw edit points on NURBS and Beziér curves/surfaces.

Profile curves:
    Draw profile (trim) curves on NURBS surfaces.

Profile numbers:
    Draw the profile curve number next to the start of profile (trim) curves. Profile curve numbers start at 0.

Tint Backfaces:
    Tint backfacing polygons so that they are easily distinguishable from frontfacing polygons.

=== Vertices ===

Markers:
    Draw small boxes showing the vertex locations. Draws the vertices slightly offset inward on the polygon face so you can tell the vertices apart from each other and the point. Unselected vertices are hollow, and selected vertices are filled.

Numbers:
    Draw the vertex number next to the vertex location. Draws numbers for vertices of different polygons in slightly different shades, to make them easier to tell apart.

Normals:
    Draw the vertex normal direction (if the vertex has a normal attribute) as a small line from the vertex marker's location. Draws normals for vertices of different polygons in slightly different shades, to make them easier to tell apart. You can change the line length using the __Normal scale__ option on the __Guides__ tab.

UV coords:
    Draw each vertex's UV texture coordinates next to the vertex marker location.

UV Backfaces:
    In UV viewports, change the fill color of back-facing polygons to make it easy to tell them apart from front-facing polygons.

UV Overlap:
    In UV viewports, change the fill color of regions where multiple primitives overlap.

=== Draw ===

The options in this column control how Houdini draws geometry in the current category.

Draw:
    The [shading mode|/basics/view] for surfaces in the current category. For example, you can have scene geometry drawn as smooth shaded, and templated geometry drawn as wireframe.

Lock Shading Mode:
    Ignore the viewport shading mode control for surfaces in the current category.
    
    For example, this is on by default for templated geometry, so (for example) changing the viewport shading mode between shaded and wireframe does not change the look of templated geometry.

Ghosted:
    Draw curves/surfaces with a grayed-out, less prominent look.

Faded:
    Ignore any color (`Cd` attribute) or any texture on curves/surfaces. Uses the default wireframe colors and the default material. This generally used for "templated" geometry. You can change the defaults on the __Effects__ tab.

Draw as X-Ray:
    Show the wireframe of any geometry hidden behind other surfaces.

Allow Lighting:
    Allow lighting to affect the look of geometry in the current category. This overrides the viewport's lighting setting.

3D Boundaries:
    Show boundaries of meshes (non-shared edges).
    
    Off:
        Don't highlight open edges.
    
    All Views:
        Highlight open edges in all viewport types.
    
    3D View Only:
        Draw open edges in 3D viewports.
    
    UV View Only:
        Draw open edges in UV viewports.
    
UV Boundaries:
    Show boundaries of UV texture coordinates on meshes (UV island edges).
    
    Off:
        Don't highlight edges of UV islands.
    
    All Views:
        Highlight edges of UV islands in all viewport types.
    
    3D View Only:
        Draw edges of UV islands in 3D viewports.
    
    UV View Only:
        Draw edges of UV islands in UV viewports.
    
    NOTE:
        Enabling either 3D or UV boundaries requires Houdini to do extra processing of the geometry in the scene. It should be fast to tumble, but can slow animation playback.

== Guides Tab ==

Floating gnomon:
    Draw a small gnomon in the bottom left corner of the view, showing the current orientation of the world axes.

Origin gnomon:
    Draw a gnomon at the world-space origin (0,0,0). (See also [how to display an object's origin/pivot|/basics/objects].)

Particle gnomon:
    Draw a small gnomon at the origin of each particle system. If the particle system's __Display Particle Axes__ option is on, and the particles have a center of mass attribute (`com`), this will show the center of mass.

View pivot:
    Draw an indicator at the world-space location about which the view rotates when tumbling.

Group and attribute list:
    Show the [group list|/basics/select#groups] in the upper right corner of the viewer.

Video safe areas:
    Draw rectangles showing the video "safe area" for picture and titles.

Field guides:
    Draw a traditional cell-animation grid overlay on top of the view. This can make it easier to align elements by eye and find points of reference between frames.
    
Camera view mask:
    Draw the view mask and overlay of the current [camera|Node:obj/cam].
    
    The parameters on the camera to control the display mask are set to a 1.85 aspect ratio and hidden by default. To show them, use __Edit rendering parameters__ in the parameter editor's gear menu, and add the __For rendering > Viewport > View Mask__ properties.

XZ, XY, and YZ Reference Planes:
    Draw a 20x20 reference grid centered at the origin in the XZ, XY, and/or YZ plane.

Node guides:
    Draw "guide geometry" created by some nodes to indicate invisible information (for example, wind direction).
    
Node handles:
    Show interaction handles created some nodes (for example, camera handles).

Follow selection mask:
    Automatically show components for selection. For example, when this is on and you go to select points, the viewport will automatically show point markers. 
    
IK Critical zone:
    Draw the IK critical zone guides for [bones|Node:obj/bone].

Object names:
    Draw the node name of each object (for example, `lamp`) at its local origin.

Object paths:
    Draw the full path of each object (for example, `/obj/subnet1/lamp`) at its local origin.

Displayed nodes:
    Draw the display geometry of objects.

Current geometry:
    Draw the geometry contained in the selected geometry node (when it's different from the display node).

Template Geometry:
    Draw templated geometry.

Selectable templates:
    Draw nodes with the selectable template flag on.

=== Additional information ===

Show Time:
    Draw timing information (frames per second (FPS), draw time, and elapsed time), in the corner of the viewer. This can be useful for testing scene performance. You should use the FPS as a reference for animation speed, and the elapsed time when comparing playback times.

    The FPS display is limited to a maximum of 120, to avoid showing extremely high and misleading values.

Geometry information:
    Draw information about the current scene/model (for example, total number of polygons and number of selected polygons) in the bottom-right corner of the viewer.

=== Selection ===

Object Selection:
    Draw selected objects with a highlighted wireframe. If you turn this off, selected objects will look exactly the same as unselected objects.

Fill Selections:
    Fill selected components with the highlight color. For example, selected faces will be filled with the selection color. When this is off, Houdini only highlights the wireframe, allowing you to see the shading/texture of selected faces. This setting affects all wire-over modes: __Wireframe Ghost__, __Hidden Line Invisible__, __Hidden Line Ghost__, __Flat Wire Shaded__, and __Smooth Wire Shaded__. Pure __Wireframe__ is not affected by this setting as it does not display faces, nor is __Flat Shaded__ or __Smooth Shaded__, both of which always fill the face.

Closure Selections:
    Draw the primitive to which the selected components "belong" in a secondary highlight color. This may be useful for NURBS and Beziér surfaces, where it might not be clear which surface a control point out in space belongs to.

    Hide:
        Do not highlighting the primitives to which the selected components belong.
        
    Hull Geometry Only:
        Only highlight NURBS and Beziér surfaces with selected control points/hulls. This is the default.
        
    Show:
        Highlight primitives to which the selected components belong. For example, selecting a polygonal point will draw the faces sharing that point using a secondary highlight.

=== Guide sizes ===

Auto DPI Scale:
    Automatically scale all guide sizes according to the monitor's reported DPI. You can turn this off to manually scale all guide sizes (this does not affect the __Guide font__ size).

Scale Normal:
    Scales the length of normal markers.

Scale Vectors:
    Scales the length of vector direction markers, such as velocity trails.
        
Point marker size:
    Scales the size of location "dot" markers, such as points.

Origin gnomon size:
    Scales the size of the large gnomon drawn at the world origin. You can turn it off completely using the __Origin gnomon__ checkbox on this tab.

Guide font:
    The relative size of marker text drawn in the view, such as point numbers.

Handle highlight:
    Controls the amount of highlighting when the mouse pointer is over a handle. "Off" does no highlighting. "Small" brightens a handle when the mouse is over it. "Normal" draws a prominent glow around a handle when the mouse is over it.

Offset vertex markers:
    Vertex markers and normals are inset into the polygon so they can be selected independently when part of a seamless mesh. When disabled, the markers and normals are placed at the actual vertex, potentially overlapping.

== Visualizers tab ==

This tab lets you arrange and save your common [visualizers|/basics/visualizers]. The 
top section of this dialog shows your common visualizers and in the bottom you can see 
your scene visualizers. You can add or delete visualizers in each section. You can also
drag-and-drop visualizers between the two sections or rearrange them within
each section. Clicking __Save As Default__ saves the arrangement of the common visualizers
as your default common visualizers which will be available in all scene file. 

Although this dialog allows you to add, delete, activate, and deactivate common and scene
visualizers, it is mostly used to review and save your list of common visualizers. In particular, it does not display your Per-Node visualizers. The visualizer  menu, accessible via ((RMB)) over the [Icon:VIEW/visualization] icon on the right side of the viewport, is the recommended way to access all visualizers relevant to a scene. 

        NOTE:
               You can drag-and-drop visualizes from the visualizer menu onto the two sections of the __Visualizers__ tab on the Display Options dialog. 

== Geometry tab ==

=== Tessellation ===

Level of Detail:
    Increases or decreases the display resolution of metaballs, NURBS, and Beziér surfaces.

Volume Quality:
    Controls the display quality of [volumes|/model/volumes] in the viewer.

    Very Low:
        Draw volumes as parallel slices along one axis. This is the fastest option but produces a visual pop as the volume rotates in the view. Overlapping volumes will produce visual artifacts.
        
    Low:
        Draw volumes as slices parallel to the viewport. This is the fastest of the view-aligned, useful for working interactively with dozens of volumes. Overlapping volumes will render correctly.
        
    Normal:
        Draw volumes as slices parallel to the viewport, with more tightly-spaced slices than the "Low" option. Balances quality and performance.
        
    High:
        Draw volumes as slices parallel to the viewport, with even more tightly-spaced slices than the "Normal" option. Slowest but best quality option. Adds some random variation to the volume sampling to break up the slices and 3D texture sampling.

    Enabling __HDR Rendering__ will remove any banding artifacts from volumes.

Polygon Convexing:
    Fixes concave polygons by tessellating them to triangles so they appear the correct shape. There are two options for determining when to redo the convexing:
    
    Fast: 
       Only redo convexing on full topology changes. Ignore changes to point position (P).
       
    Accurate: 
       Redo convexing on full topology and point attribute changes.

Subdivision Polygon Limit:
    The maximum polygon count that subdivision can produce when subdivision is enabled for that object. If exceeded, try the next subdivision level down until the resulting polygon count is acceptable, which may be no subdivision at all. This is expressed in millions of polygons. Increasing this limit may cause very long updates for subdivision objects and long draw times.

=== Wireframe ===

Wire Width:
    The thickness (in pixels) of wireframe lines. The range of available values depends on the OpenGL driver.

Wire Blend:
    Opacity of the wireframe in "Shaded wireframe" mode, from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque). You may want to turn this down to keep surface color/texture visible underneath a dense wireframe.

Interior Wire Alpha:
    The visibility of "interior" wireframes (such as inside tetrahedrons), from 0 (not visible) to 1 (drawn the same as exterior wireframe).

Shade Open Curves:
    Apply lighting to curves. This is useful when using curves to represent hair.

Select wireframe surfaces as if solid:
    Lets you select surfaces in wireframe mode by clicking where the surface would be if it was drawn.

Wire over packed geometry:
    Show polygon outlines on meshes in packed geometry when drawing a wire-over-shaded mode. Disabling this hides the outlines on packed geometry, making meshes appear as a single shape, which packed geometry technically is. 

=== Particles === (particle)

Display particles:
    How Houdini draws particles and disconnected points.

    Point:
        Draw points as uniform dots, controlled by __Point Size__ (in pixels). In this mode, close and far points are drawn at the same size.
        
    Pixel:
        Draw points as single pixels. This may be useful for very dense particle simulations.
        
    Line:
        Draw particles as streaks. This only affects particles (disconnected points are drawn as dots).
        
    Disc:
        Draw particles as filled circles, with the radius controlled by __Disc size__ (in world space units). In this mode, particles are drawn as actual geometry, so closer particles appear bigger than far particles. This only affects particles (disconnected points are drawn as dots).

Display Sprites:
    If particles have sprite attributes (see the [Sprite node|Node:dop/popsprite]), draw the sprite image at the particle location.

Point Size:
    The size (in pixels) of particle and unconnected points, when __Display particles__ is "Point". 

Disc Size:
    The size (in Houdini units), of the filled circles, when __Display particles__ is "Disc".

Orient Discs to N:
    When __Display particles__ is "Disc", this orients the discs with the particle's normal. If the particle doesn't have a normal, it uses the particle's velocity.

Sprite Texture Limit:
    The minimum and maximum display size of a [sprite|/nodes/pop/sprite] texture.

=== Instancing ===

Point Instancing:
    Use OpenGL point instancing to replace the points of [Instance objects|Node:obj/instance] (and any other objects with the proper instancing properties) with the instanced geometry in the viewport. See [instancing|/copy/instancing] for more information.
    
    To increase viewport performance, you can lower the percentage of the total number of points that are replaced with regerenced geometry. For example, setting it to `50` will only replace half the points with the instanced geometry. The other half will instance the __Stand-in geometry__.

Stand-In Geometry:
    What to draw for points that can't be replaced with the referenced geometry (when the __Point Instancing__ percentage is less than 100, or the number of points to instance exceeds the __Instancing Limit__). "Display off" draws nothing, "Location marker" draws a dot, and "Bounding box" draws the bounding box of the referenced geometry.

=== Normals ===

Auto Generate:
    The type of normal to generate when no normals exist on the geometry.

    Point Normals: 
        Normals are generated on points, which is fast but cannot visualize
        cusps on sharp edges (such as boxes). 
    Vertex Normals:
        Normals are generated on vertices which can visualize sharp edges. 
        The surface will be smoothly shaded as long as the angle between two
        polygons is less than the cusp angle (below). Vertex normals are
        slower to generate and display than point normals.

Cusp Angle: 
    The angle, in degrees, at which the surface stops smoothly shading and
    instead creates a cusp. The angle is measured between neighboring polygons.
    This has no effect if __Point Normals__ are auto-generated.

Vertex Normal Limit:
    The upper limit, in millions of polygons, where normal auto-generation will
    switch from __Vertex Normals__  to __Point Normals__. Large models often 
    take too long to generate vertex normals and display speed is affected as 
    well. In this case, it is better to use a [Normal SOP|Node:sop/normal] to 
    generate vertex normals on the geometry if vertex normals are desired, 
    rather than have the viewport continually recalculate them.

== Scene tab == (scene)

===Scene===

=== Scene ===

Antialiasing Samples:
    Smooths edges of lines and polygons in the viewport. Increasing this increases the amount of framebuffer memory Houdini uses. Only use modes higher than 4x if your graphics card has 2GB of VRAM or more. Modes above 16x are significantly slower and give diminishing returns on quality, so it is best to find a "good enough" setting rather than maxing this value.

HDR Rendering:
    Produces higher quality render of volumes and transparency. This doubles the amount of framebuffer memory Houdini uses. When this is on, flipbooks will contain HDR images.
    
    You can use this with a LUT (in the __Viewport__ tab) to view super-white values.

Enable X-Ray Drawing:
    Draw objects with the X-ray flag (bones and nulls) as wireframes when they're behind solid surfaces.
    
X-Ray Strength:
    Controls the strength of the X-Ray wireframe. Values less than 1 will dim the lines, and values greater than 1 will widen the lines.

Enable Object Origins:
    Draw axis and pivot points at the object origin of objects with the Display Origin flag.

=== Onion Skinning === (onionskinning)

[Image:/images/char/onionskinning2.png]

Allow Onion Skinning:
    Geometry objects are drawn with onion skins if their _Onion Skinning_ 
    parameter is set. This is a global toggle to quickly disable all onion 
    skinning in the scene, without the need to turn off each individual 
    objects' _Onion Skinning_ parameter.

Frames Before:
    Shows a number of skins for frames in the future, before the action at the
    current frame has taken place. These skins can be tinted with the color 
    swatch to differentiate them from the past frames.

Frames After:
    Shows a number of skins for frames in the past, after the action at the
    current frame has taken place. These skins can be tinted with the color
    swatch to differentiate them from the future frames.

Frame Increment:
    The number of frames between skins. A frame increment of 1 will show 
    tightly packed frames, whereas higher increments will skip frames. Fast
    motions are easier to see with a small frame increment, while slow motions
    are easier to see with a larger frame increment.

Skin Opacity:
    Each skin can be drawn with transparency so that the main geometry and 
    other skins can be seen more easily. A value of 1 makes the skins opaque,
    and values closer to zero make the skins more faint.
    

=== Color Correction ===

Gamma:
    Applies gamma correction to user geometry in the viewport. This does not affect guides, handles, and other interface elements.

LUT:
    Applies a Lookup Table (LUT) to the use geometry, after gamma is applied.

Apply to Background Image:
    Apply the gamma correction and LUT to the background image as well as the user geometry.


         

== Viewport tab == (viewport)

The controls on this tab apply to the "active" split viewport. To make a split viewport active, move the mouse pointer over it and press ((N)). The menus of the active viewport are drawn in yellow.

Name:
    Name for the viewport, for example `persp1` for a perspective viewport.
    
Type:
    What kind of view the viewport shows -- "Perspective", "UV", or an orthographic view direction such as "Front".

=== Information ===

[Image:/images/ui/viewport_menus_anno.png]

Show Name:
    Show the viewport options menu (titled with the viewport name) in the top right corner of the viewport.
    
Show Camera Name:
    Show the camera options menu (titled with the name of the camera the view is looking through) in the top right corner of the viewport. If the view is not locked to a camera, the menu is titled "no cam".

Show State Status:
    Show additional text information about the current state, if any.
    
Show Status Badges:
    Show icon badges beside the viewport menus to indicate various viewport settings or state that is relevant to the user.
    
=== Clipping ===

Homing automatically adjusts:
    Which clipping planes are automatically adjusted when you home the viewport. If you set explicit near and/or far clipping planes, this lets you prevent them from being changed by homing.

Near/Far Clipping Planes:
    The nearest distance to and the farthest distance from the view camera to draw geometry. That is, geometry nearer to the view camera than the near clipping plane, or farther away than the far clipping plane, is not visible in the view.

    Due to GPU Z-buffering issues, the far/near ratio should never be more than one million. If you enter a larger range is selected, Houdini will simply move the near clip plane out until the far/near ratio is one million.

Minimum Home Size:
    When homing, treat geometry smaller than this size as if it was this size (in Houdini units). This prevents huge camera moves when you home a scene that is very small (such as a single point).

=== Display ===

Aspect Ratio:
    Sets the ratio of width divided by height (eg. 16:9 would be 1.777). This only has an effect when the viewport isn't looking through a camera.

Crop Offset:
    Sets the center of the crop region, in 0..1 screen space. The default is the center of the viewport (0.5, 0.5).

Crop Size:
    Sets the size of the crop region, in 0..1 screen space. The default is (1,1) - no scale.

View Mask Opacity:
    The opacity of the mask showing which areas of the view will not be rendered (when looking through a camera), from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (full opacity black).
    
    For example, a very low value would display a transparent mask; a medium value would display a gray mask; and a high value would display a black mask.
    
Stereo Display Mode:
    The display mode of stereoscopic images in MPlay. You can use passive polarization glasses to view the images in horizontal interlace mode.

=== UV Viewport ===

Auto Detect UV Attribute Type:
    Automatically detects the attribute type in a UV texture editor viewport.
    
UV Viewport Attribute Type:
    The attribute type for UV viewports, when __Auto Detect Attribute Type__ is off.

UV Attribute:
    The UV attribute to display in UV viewports. This can also be set via the UV menu in the top right corner of a UV viewport.


== Effects tab ==

Houdini may disable some controls on this tab if your graphics card does not support them. 

=== Lighting ===

Lighting:
    How to show lighting in the viewer.

    No lighting:
        Ignore scene lights, show objects at constant brightness.
        
    Headlight Only:
        Ignore scene lights, show objects as if lit by a single virtual sunlight centered on the camera. You can set the __Headlight direction__ below. 
        
    Normal Lighting:
        Use the scene lights to light objects.
        
    High Quality Lighting:
        Use a slower, higher-quality lighting model that better matches how the rendered scene would look.
        
    High Quality Lighting with Shadows:
        Use high quality lighting and approximate the effect of shadows for lights that have shadowing turned on. This is slower and uses more memory, but greatly increases the quality of the view.

        Houdini recalculates a light's shadow map(s) when its position, orientation, or projection changes. You may want to disable shadows while editing a light to improve interactivity.

    In the High Quality Lighting modes, the Flat [shading modes|/basics/view] are not available. Smooth shading is always used. The High Quality Lighting modes only work with a perspective view. [Orthographic|/basics/quickref] view mode will use normal quality lighting instead.

Diffuse:
    Show the effect of direct lighting on surfaces.

Ambient:
    Show the effect of ambient lighting on surfaces.

Specular:
    Show the effect of specular reflection on surfaces.

Emission:
    Show the effect of light emission (glow) from surfaces.

Light Sampling:
    The number of samples to use when rendering area and environment lights when __Lighting__ is "High Quality". Higher numbers produce more accurate results, with slightly lower performance.
    
Headlight Intensity:
    The brightness of the headlight when __Lighting__ is "Headlight".
    
Headlight Direction:
    The headlight is treated as a distant light with parallel rays. This sets the direction of the headlight rays, relative to the camera. The default is over, behind, and to the right of the camera.
    
Headlight Specular: 
    Show specular highlights caused by the headlight, when __Lighting__ is "Headlight". When this is off, the headlight casts diffuse light only.

Headlight Occlusion:
    Do an ambient occlusion pass after lighting to increase contrast on local features and give a better sense of depth to models.

=== Material === (material)

Use Materials:
    Color objects in the view using their assigned materials. When this is off, Houdini draws objects using the __Default Diffuse__, __Default Specular__, __Default Ambient__, and __Default Emission__ below.

Transparency:
    Draw objects with per-pixel alpha, texture maps with alpha, or material 
    transparency using alpha blending. When this is off, Houdini draws any pixels with non-zero alpha as opaque.

    Cutout:
        Transparent objects are rendered as opaque if the alpha is greater than zero. This doesn't require an additional pass or blending, and is well suited to rendering billboards. 

    Low:
        Transparent objects are only sorted by object order. Overlapping surfaces within an object may be rendered incorrectly, unless objects are sorted manually in the scene hierarchy list or a [Sort SOP|Node:sop/sort] is used at the end of the object's geometry network.
        
    Medium:
        Transparent objects are sorted per-pixel, producing a more realistic display of complex transparent objects.

    High:
        Transparent objects are sorted per-pixel and are shadowed, if shadows are enabled. More render passes are used to resolve transparent layering issues, if they are needed.

Displacement:
    Draw geometry with materials that have a displacement map as displaced surfaces using adaptive tessellation. This may cause a reduction in performance, which can be adjusted with the __Level__ slider. 
    
    OpenGL 4.0 is required for this feature. This option will be disabled if OpenGL 4.0 is not available.

    Level:
        Lower values produce fewer tessellated triangles, resulting better performance but lower quality results. Values greater than one produce more triangles than recommended by the adaptive tessellation, up to the OpenGL tessellation limit which is hardware-dependent.
    
    TIP: 
       Displacement should be turned off when attempting to select edges or polygons on a surface with a displacement material. Selection does not take the displacement into account so it will be difficult to accurately select components with displacement on.

Default Diffuse:
    Diffuse color to use for surfaces that have no material.
    
Default Specular:
    Specular color to use for surfaces that have no material.
    
Default Ambient:
    Ambient color to use for surfaces that have no material.
    
Default Emission:
    Emission color for surfaces that have no material. This produces a constant shading effect.


=== Shadows ===

Ambient Occlusion:
    Enables screen-space ambient occlusion, when __Lighting__ is "High quality". This shadows objects based on the amount of ambient light that could reach a surface. Areas in corners and sunken areas will be shadowed. Turning this on decreases display performance.
    
    The numeric value increases the quality and range of effect of the occlusion, softening
    the overall effect.

    NOTE:
        Changing the scene file's [Unit Length option|/ref/windows/mainprefs#hipfile] will change the extent of the ambient occlusion effect. 

Shadow Quality:
    Controls the quality of shadow visualization in the view. Higher levels give better shadow approximations, especially for area and environment lights, but decrease display performance.

    Point:
        All lights are shadowed as if they were point lights, producing hard shadow edges. This is the lowest quality setting.
            
    Antialiased Point:
        Improve the shadow edges by softening jagged edges caused by light map aliasing.
        
    Area:
        Area lights use many shadow maps to produce a soft shadow effect. Environment lights perform more sampling. This has no effect on other light types (point will be used in these cases). Moving an area light with this option on will result in slower interactivity.
        
    Antialiased Area:
        Soften the jagged edges of shadows, which improves the soft shadow look.

Sensitivity:
    Correct for shadow map artifacts, which look like moiré patterns or "shadow acne" on surfaces. In general, increase the first value to fix self-shadowing artifacts on surfaces that are edge-on to the light, and the second value for surfaces perpendicular to the direction of the light.

Light Map Size:
    Controls the resolution of the shadow maps, based on the individual light object's settings, or using a global setting for all lights.  Increasing the shadow map size will reduce the jaggedness of shadow edges and improve fine shadow detail. Larger maps may affect performance and will use more graphics memory.

    Override Light Map Size:
        Ignore the light object's shadow map size and use the specified resolution. All Light maps are square.
            
    Use Light Map Size up to:
        Use the light object's shadow map size, but limit it to the maximum resolution specified. If an object's shadow map size is not square, then the width is used for both the width and height of the viewport shadow map.


== Reflections == 

Enable Reflections:
    Enable reflections using reflection cubemaps. This simulates reflections
    by rendering the scene to a cubemap with the reflection object removed,
    at the reflective object's centroid. Reflective objects are those with
    a material with a `GL Reflect` parameter that is greater than zero.

HDR Reflections:
    Use a FP16 cubemap to store high-dynamic range reflections. When 
    disabled, an 8b cubemap is used (standard 0-1 color range). HDR 
    reflections look brighter, but use twice the texture memory.

Reflection Map Size:
    Resolution of the cubemap's square images, in pixels. Larger maps 
    produce sharper reflections at the expense of increased reflection map 
    generation time and texture memory use.

Min Reflection:
    Require that a material have a `GL Reflect` parameter set to at least
    this value, otherwise do not consider the material reflective. 
    No reflection cubemaps are generated for objects with non-reflective 
    materials. This can reduce the number of reflection maps generated for
    very dull materials.
        

== Grid tab ==

=== 3D Ortho ===

These options control the display of the grid in orthographic viewports. To show grids in a perspective viewport, use the XZ, XY, and YZ Reference Plane options on the __Guides__ tab.

Display Ortho Grid:
    Show a grid in orthographic viewports.

Grid Offset:
    The distance in X, Y, and Z between the grid origin and the world-space origin.
    
Grid Spacing:
    The horizontal and vertical distance between grid lines, in Houdini units.
    
Grid Ruler:
    Draw every <<n>>th grid line thicker. Set this to 0 to not draw thicker lines.
            
=== Texture Viewport ===

These options control the display of the grid in UV editor viewports.

Display Reference Grid:
    Show a grid using the given __Grid spacing__.
    
Grid Spacing:
    The distance between grid lines, in UV coordinate values.

Display Grid Over Image:
    Show a pixel grid over the texture image, using the __Grid pixel spacing__ and __Grid pixel offset__.

Grid Pixel Spacing/Grid Pixel Offset:
    The placement and size of the pixel grid, in pixels. You can use decimal values, for example an offset of 0.5 to snap to pixel centers.

Clamp Grid to Image:
    Don't show the grid outside the boundaries of the image.

Display Tile Boundaries:
    Draw guide lines representing the boundary around the 0-1 tiling of the image.

== Background tab ==

Color Scheme:
    The background color scheme for viewports.
    
Display Environment Lights as Backgrounds:
    Display environment lights as the background in all viewports (when the environment light's __Enable light in viewport__ parameter is on).

Display Background Images:
    Show an image in the background of the viewports. This can be useful for tracing over an image, or looking at a 3D model in front of a context image.
    
    When a viewport is looking through a camera, the camera's __Background image__ parameter specifies the image. For viewports that are not locked to a camera, Houdini uses the images specified in the tabs below. 
    
Use Texture Filtering:
    Oversample the background image so zooming on the image looks smooth and blurry instead of blocky.

Apply Zoom to Background:
    Zooming the viewport changes the size of the background image. When this is off, the image remains the same size when you zoom in or out. This option is ignored when __Auto-place image__ is on.

Disk File/COP image:
    Get the image from a file or a compositing node. Click the chooser button to choose a file/node.

Environment Map:
    Draw the image as a 360 degree environment map rather than a 2D image. The image should be a lat-long map or a 6-face cube map.

Auto-Place Image:
    Automatically scale the image to fit the image inside the viewport (not available for UV viewports). When this option is off, you can use the __Image Offset__ and __Image Scale__ controls to place and scale the image manually.

Image Offset/Image Scale:
    Manually control the placement and scale of the background image in the viewport, when __Auto Place Image__ is off. A scale of 1 uses the original image size. A scale of 0.5 would make the image half size. Not available for UV viewports.

Minimum/Maximum UV:
    The smallest and largest UV values display horizontally (U) and vertically (V) in the viewport.

Image Quality:
    Controls the fidelity of the background image by downscaling it. Lower values give lower quality background images but use less memory.

== Texture tab == (texture)

=== General ===

Display Textures:
    Show surface textures in the view. Turning this off can increase display performance. 
    
Multi Texturing:
    Displays all layers of multi-layered textures. Turning this off will only display the first texture, but can increase display performance.
    
Projected Textures:
    Show spotlight projection maps in the view (see the __Projector map__ parameter on the light object). This adds one drawing pass per spotlight in the scene. Even when this option is on, the projected maps will not affect transparent objects or volumes.

Mipmap Textures:
    Increase the quality of displayed textures by producing a mipmap for
    enhanced filtering. When this option is off, textured objects will sparkle
    when viewed at a smaller scale. This option causes textures to use 50% more memory on the graphics card.

Anisotropic Filtering:
    Higher values increase the quality of textured objects when a surface is nearly parallel to the view direction. Increasing this will slightly decrease display performance.

=== Texture Cache ===

Texture Cache Size:
    The maximum amount of memory to use for textures, both 2D and 3D (in megabytes).
    
    OpenGL always stores textures in main memory and may swap them to and from the graphics card, so this setting can affect the amount of memory available to Houdini. The maximum texture cache size is limited on 32 bit computers.

Single Texture Limit:
   The maximum amount of memory that a single texture can consume (in MiB). Even with a large amount of available VRAM, very large textures can have performance issues. This option is automatically set based on the detected VRAM (where possible), from 64MiB to 256MiB. It is not saved to .hip files.

Viewport Texture Use:
    Displays the amount of texture cache currently in use. To flush the cache, use 
    __Render > Update Textures__ from the main menu.

Dynamically reduce texture scale:
    When drawing the viewport, if the total size of all textures used is greater than the texture cache size, texture thrashing will result. This causes severe performance degradation as textures are continually reloaded and deleted on every redraw. If this option is on, Houdini detects this situation and on the next redraw scales textures to a size that will fit in the cache.

Reduce 2D textures:
    Apply dynamic texture scaling to 2D textures. The box next to the option shows the current dynamic scale.

Reduce 3D textures:
    Apply dynamic texture scaling to 3D textures. The box next to the option shows the current dynamic scale.

=== 2D Textures ===

Limit Resolution:
    Limit the size of 2D textures to the specified size (if it is less than the maximum size allowed by the graphics card). When this option is off, texture sizes are only limited to the maximum size supported by the graphics card. This option can reduce graphics card memory usage and improve performance, at the expense of decreasing display quality of large textures.
    
    This only affects new textures and will not cause updates of loaded textures (use
    __Render > Update Textures__ from the main menu to apply the limit to these textures).

    Cube maps are also affected by this size, though it applies to their faces. The maximum size of shadow maps is controlled on the __Effects__ tab.

HDR Textures:
    Show High Dynamic Range texture images. Using HDR images will give better shading on textured surfaces when lighting is on in the view.

    Full HDR:
       All HDR formats are allowed (32 bit and 16 bit). This uses the most graphics memory, as 32 bit HDR images use 4x the amount of RAM that an 8 bit image does. This may also negatively affect performance on older graphics hardware.

    16b HDR only:
       Use only 16 bit floating point textures images. Any 32 bit HDR images will be down-sampled. This provides a good balance between rendering quality, graphics memory use, and performance.

    8b SDR:
        Down-sample all textures to 8 bit (Standard Dynamic Range). Any super-whites are clamped to (0,1) (black,white). HDR textures may look washed out in this mode.

    8b Compressed:
        Compress all textures to 1/4 or 1/8 their size by reducing color resolution. This option will reduce the memory used by textures, but also reduce the color accuracy of textures.

Scale Textures:
    Scale all 2D textures to a percentage of their original size. You can use this to quickly improve performance of a highly-textured scene if it is stuttering on redraw.

    This scale is applied _before_ the __Limit Resolution__ option.

=== 3D Textures ===

Limit Resolution:
    Limit the resolution of 3D textures, which are often used to represent volumes.
    
    If you need better quality, increase the limit values. *Do not turn this off* unless you really know what you're doing. Larger 3D textures can use a huge amount of graphics card RAM. High resolution (simulation) volumes can use far more memory than reasonable to display on a graphics card. (When this option is off, volumes are limited to the maximum OpenGL 3D texture size.)
    
    This only affects new 3D textures.

Use 2D Texture Settings:
    Copy the __HDR textures__ and __Scale textures__ settings from the 2D textures options. When this is off, you can specify separate values for 3D textures below.
    
    (8 bit Compressed is not supported for 3D textures, so if the 2D setting is "8b Compressed", 3D textures will use 8 bit SDR.)

HDR Textures:
    Show High Dynamic Range color and opacity for volumes and other 3D textures. This can improve the quality of volumes at the expense of performance and graphics memory use. 

Scale Textures:
    Scale all 3D textures to a percentage of their original size. This can be useful for
    displaying extremely large simulated volumes.
    
    This scale is applied _before_ the __Limit Resolution__ option.
          
== Optimize tab ==

=== Culling ===

Visible Objects:
    Only object names that match this pattern will be visible in the view.

Remove Backfaces:
    In shaded view modes, do not draw polygons that face away from the camera. This can improve display speed on very heavy polygonal geometry.
    
    For closed (airtight) surfaces, back faces are not visible anyway, but open surfaces often have visible back faces that will disappear when this option is on. For example, if you create a cylinder (without end caps) and look down at it with this option on, only the front half of the cylinder will appear in the view.

Draw Hulls Only:
    Draw the hulls of certain primitives instead of the normal geometry.
    This applies to NURBS surfaces and curves, Bezier surfaces and curves,
    metaballs, volumes, and VDBs.

Distance-based Packed Geometry Culling:
    When enabled, replace packed geometry with bounding boxes if the total polygon count of all the packed geometry within the view frustum exceeds the __Scene Polygon Limit__. Distant packed geometry is replaced with boxes first. This preserves viewport performance for large scene files at the expense of visual quality, making it easier to navigate the scene.

Scene Polygon Limit:
    The maximum number of polygons to draw in the scene. When this is exceeded, some packed primitives will be replaced by their bounding boxes until the total number of polygons is under the limit.

Bounding Boxes:
    Determines whether to use wireframe or shaded bounding boxes when replacing geometry in the scene, or omit them entirely.

    None:
        Remove the geometry but don't show anything in its place.
    Wireframe:
        Always show wireframe bounding boxes for culled geometry, regardless of the main viewport shading mode.
    Shaded:
        Always show shaded bounding boxes for culled geometry, regardless of the main viewport shading mode.
    Current Shading Mode:
        Use wireframe bounding boxes when the geometry is being wireframe, or shaded if the geoemtry is being drawn shaded.

Optimize Packed Geometry:
    Perform a series of optimizations on the packed geometry which make it faster to display. The downside of this is that the wireframe representation will no longer match the original geometry's topology and it will take slightly longer to initially process the geometry.

=== Material Assignment === (mat_assign)

Apply Material Stylesheets:
    Evaluate and apply material assignments and overrides based on material
    stylesheets affecting the object and geometry. When disabled, the effects
    of any stylesheets will not be scene but the scene may update and draw 
    faster.

Apply Per-primitive Stylesheets:
    Allow material stylesheets to be evaluated on a per-primitive basis when
    applied to geometry. When off, only the object assignment is used.

Apply Stylesheets to Packed Geometry:
    Allow material stylesheets to be applied to portions of geometry that is
    packed inside a packed primitive. When off, only the packed primitive
    assignment or object assignment will be used.

Use Material Overrides:
    Allow material overrides from material stylesheets or the
    `material_override` attribute. When off, material overrides are ignored.

Single Object Material Limit:
    The maximum number of materials and material variants allowed to be assigned
    to a single object by material stylesheets, overrides, or
    `shop_materialpath` attribute. When this is exceeded, the remaining
    primitives will be assigned either the default material, object material,
    or the packed primitive material. A note is made of this in the viewport
    information button on the right toolbar.

Material Assignments:
    Limit when material assignments are updated, as this can be expensive.

    Always Update:
        Update whenever material assignments need to be updated.
    Disable during Playback:
        Update when material assignments need to be updated unless
        Houdini is playing or scrubbing.
    Manual:
        Do not update unless __Update Materials__ is manually clicked.

Interactively Update Materials:
    Update materials when they change. When disabled, changes to the materials
    themselves will not be reflected in the viewport unless __Update Materials__ is pressed.

Update Materials:
    Forcibly update all material assignments, stylesheets, and materials.
    This is useful for stylesheets with external script files when those files
    change (they are not monitored for changes), or when automatic updates have
    been disabled.

=== Crowd Agents ===

LOD Agent Reduction:
    Automatically generate a series of reduced-polygon levels of detail for agent shapes, and swap them in based on an agent's distance to camera, to make display of far-away agents faster. Each level has half as many polygons as the previous one. The closer the slider is to the "performance" side, the more low-poly levels Houdini generates.

Shape Point Cutoff:
    The minimum number of polygons in a reduced-polygon model generated by __LOD agent reduction__. Houdini will not generate any levels of detail with fewer than this many polygons.

Max LOD Levels:
    The maximum number of reduced levels of detail generated by __LOD agent reduction__. For example, if an agent model has 100000 polygons and __Max LOD levels__ is `4`, Houdini will generate levels with polygon counts of 50000, 25000, 12500, 6250, and then stop. Note that Houdini may not actually generate this many levels if it reaches the __Shape point cutoff__.

Base LOD Level:
    Which reduced level of detail to use for the display of the closest agents. The default is `0`, meaning use the original model. For example, setting this to `1` would use the first reduced level of detail (with half as many polygons as the original model) even close to the camera. This lets you quickly and drastically reduce the overall polygon count of a crowd scene for better display performance.

Single Bone Deform:
    Choose whether agent models are deformed by all bone weights (up to 4), or optimize performance by only deforming based on the highest-weight bone.

    Disabled:
        Always use full deformation (best quality).

    Reduced LOD Agents Only:
        Use full deformation for the primary level of detail, and single bone deformation for reduced levels of detail.
        
    Enabled:
        Always use single bone deformation (fastest).

Wireframe Display:
    Agent rigs can be displayed in several ways when in wireframe mode.

    Line:
        Rig joints are connected with a line segment. This can be faster than
        bone display depending on the graphics hardware.
    Bone:
        Rig joints are connected with shaded bones (default).

=== Interactivity ===

Interactive Mode:
    Tells viewport plugins ("render hooks") to continuously update during user interaction (tumbling, tracking, dollying). This only affects viewport plugins, it has no effect on normal Houdini viewport drawing. The plugin must look at this option and implement its own 'performant' drawing mode, it is not automatic.
