= FBX Import Window =

== Overview ==

FBX (sometimes called "Filmbox") is an interchange file format used to
move 3D animation data between software packages.

# Choose __File > Import > Filmbox FBX__.
# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_file] chooser button next to the __File__ field and choose the file you want to import.
# Click __Import__ to replace the current scene, or __Merge__ to merge the imported data into the current scene.

NOTE:
	To properly export vertex caches from Maya(tm), the "Export Quick Select Set as Geometry Cache File(s)" option needs
	to be checked.
	
== Exporting point animation from Maya ==	

To export animated point data, you will need to create a vertex cache in Maya. A vertex cache is a set of files that defines 
positions for every vertex of the geometry at every frame over an animation interval.

To do this in Maya, select the object whose points you have animated, make sure the main menu type is set to "Animation", 
and in the menu, go to "Geometry Cache->Create New Cache". It is also highly recommended to ensure that the cache type
is set to "Double" before create the cache. To do this, click on the options box next to the "Create New Cache" menu item, 
and make sure that the "Store points as" option is set to "Double".

Once you have your geometry cache, you can export it to FBX. When doing so, make sure that the "Export Quick Select Set as 
Geometry Cache File(s)" exporter option is checked, otherwise Maya will ignore all vertex cache information.


== Filter options ==

Cameras:
    Import cameras.
Joints and Skin:
    Import joints, bones and skinning information.
Geometry:
    Import geometry - meshes, triangulated NURBS, etc.
Lights:
    Import lights.
Animation:
    Import animation, including vertex cache files.
Materials:
    Import materials and textures.

== Animation options ==

Resampling:
    This menu determines what animation curves are resampled, as well as the frequency of resampling. Please note that animation curves
    for objects with any kind of pivots will always be resampled.
    
    For example, if the curve is to be sampled at every frame, set the sampling frequency parameter to 1. If the curve is to sampled
    once every two frames, set this parameter to 2, and so on.
    
    Resample TCB Curves Only:
        Only curves exported as TCB (Tension-Continuity-Bias) types will be
        resampled. This is the default setting since native TCB curves are
        currently not supported.
        
    Resample All Cubic Curves:
        All cubic curves will be resampled down to linear key interpolation.
        
Override FBX Frame Rate:
	If checked, the frame rate stored in the FBX file will be ignored, and the one provided by the user will be used instead. This
	is useful if an application that exported the original file did not set the frame rate correctly.
        
Override Scene Frame Range:
	If checked, the FBX file will override your scene's frame range and set it based on the last keyframe found in the FBX file 
	
== Character options ==

Hide Joints Attached to Skin:
	If checked, imported joints that are attached to skin geometry will be
	hidden.

Convert Joints To ZYX Rotation Order:
	If checked, imported joints will get their rotation order converted to
	ZYX. This option will also cause animation curves to be resampled to
	ensure correctness of the conversion.

Create Sibling Bones for Visualization:
	If checked, additional bones will be created as siblings of the null joints, in order to have a visual representation of the rig. 
	If unchecked, the visualization nodes will be created internally to the null objects. 

== Material options ==        

Import Materials As:
	This option determines how materials will be imported. 
	
	Principled Shaders 
		Each material's surface is represented as Principle Shader material nodes. Textures and corresponding parameters are also represented.
		For closer parity, please export Stingray Materials from Maya, which support more traditional PBR parameters than the default Lambert and Phong materials. 
		
	FBX Shader Nodes:
		Each material's surface is represented as a special VEX FBX Shader with standard parameters such as diffuse,
		ambient, emissive, etc. components.
		
	VOP Networks:
		Each material's surface is represented as a VOP shader network constructed from various VOP nodes. While
		parameters similar to the ones in FBX Shaders are exposed, individual shader components inside the shader
		can be rearranged and edited as the user desires.
	
== Compatibility options ==

Compatibility Mode:
	Determines how values in FBX nodes are interpreted. Some exporters output information differently from what the FBX
	standard dictates, and thus workarounds for these issues are often useful. This menu allows the user to choose which
	set of workarounds, if any, is to be used on import.
	
	FBX Standard:
		FBX data is interpreted in strict accordance with FBX rules and documentation. Files from FBX exporters which
		output anything other than what FBX standard dictates may look incorrect on input.
		
	Compatible with Maya:
		FBX data is interpreted as coming specifically from the Maya(tm) FBX exporter, and adjustments are made appropriately 
		in order to make the imported scene look exactly as its original source in Maya(tm).

Single-Precision Vertex Caches:
    Forces the importer to treat all Maya(tm) vertex cache files
    as if they were exported with
    single-precision (float), instead of double precision. This is necessary since FBX SDK incorrectly imports any
    single-precision vertex cache files.

Triangulate NURBS and Patches:
    Forces the importer to triangulate NURBS and patch surfaces. If unchecked, patches are converted to NURBS on import.
    Note that information such as skinning and vertex caches will not be preserved on these objects.
   
Import Global Ambient Light:
    Allows importing the single global ambient scene light.
    This light exists in addition to any lights defined in the scene;
    however, some FBX exporters do not set it correctly,
    in which cases it may be useful not to import it.
    
    If objects with geometry caches look extremely distorted,
    try turning this option on.
    
Import Blend Deformers as Blend SOPs:
	If checked, any objects with Blend deformers on them will be imported
	as Blend SOPs. Otherwise, blend deformations will be imported as channels.
	
	The main advantage of importing blending as SOPs is the resulting flexibility
	to adjust blend targets' geometry and blend weight values; however, there is a
	possibility that blending animation will not be exactly the same as that of the
	original file.

Segment Scale Compensate Already Baked In:
	Assume that the FBX file has segment scale compensation already baked
	in. This should be turned off for FBX files exported from versions of
	Maya older than 2010.

== General options ==
    
File Paths:
    Determines how file paths to textures and the original FBX file are set on import.
    
    Keep Absolute:
        All paths are stored as absolute paths. If any referenced files are moved, paths in the saved scene will need to be
        changed by hand.
    	
    Convert to Relative:
        The importer will attempt to convert all paths to relative paths. If the FBX file is merged with the current scene, 
        all paths will be made relative to the current location of the Houdini scene file. If the FBX is replacing an entire scene,
        all paths will be made relative to the location of the FBX file. Note that this requires the resultant Houdini scene to be saved into
        the same directory where the original FBX file is located.

Unlock Geometry File SOPs:
    Leaves all imported File and Capture SOPs unlocked after import. This means that FBX geometry is referenced from the original
    FBX file on disk, and is not stored in Houdini HIP file. Note that for skinned objects, point weights will not be re-imported
    when the File SOP re-cooks, and are always stored as a copy in the Override SOP.

Unlock Deformation File CHOPs:
    Leaves all imported File CHOPs, which are responsible for deformations such as blending and vertex caching, unlocked 
    after import. This means that deformation data is referenced from the original FBX file on disk, and is not stored in 
    Houdini HIP file.

Import Null Nodes as Subnets:
    If checked, all grouping null nodes will be imported as subnets, and their children will be placed inside of each subnet.
    Note that nodes which represents joints in a skeleton will still be imported as nulls, regardless of this option's value.
    If unchecked, grouping null nodes will be imported as empty geometry containers, in order to not be confused with nulls 
    that get exported as locators. 

Import Directly Into /obj Network:
    If checked, imports all geometry and objects from the current FBX file directly into /obj network, instead of creating a
    separate subnet per FBX file.

Convert to Y-up Coordinate System:
    If checked, the entire FBX scene will be converted to the Y-up coordinate system.  If unchecked, the scene will be imported
    as-is.
