= QuickTime Movie =

NOTE:
    You will need to install or update the QuickTime player to version 7.1 or later.

Output File:
    Path and file name of the movie. Click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_file] to open the [File Dialog|file].
    
    There is currently no support for container formats other that `.mov`.
    
Start/End:
    Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame and end frame).
    
Resolution:
    Specifies the horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions for the movie.

Color:
    The name of the channel in the output to create the movie from. This should almost always be `C` (the color channel). If you are rendering out multi-plane pic files from mantra, you may want to change this. See [mantra output driver|Node:out/ifd].    

Audio Source:
    Allows you to choose whether to whether to export the current audio track from MPlay or to source an external file for the audio.       
    
    Exporting the current audio track will export it as an `.aiff` file to QuickTime.  This exported audio will be stretched the same as it is in MPlay.  When sourcing an external audio file, the __Insert Audio Without Transcoding__ checkbox will be turned on, while for exporting the current audio track from Mplay, it is usually off. 

Audio File:
    If you choose to use an external audio file in __Audio Source__ you can click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_file] to open the [File Dialog|file] and choose the audio file.

Insert Audio Without Transcoding:
    Turning this checkbox on suppresses the audio compression dialog from QuickTime and inserts the audio stream directly into the final movie.
    
    For example, if QuickTime does not you compress the audio with an mp3 codec, enabling this option will allow you to still get an mp3 audio track into the movie.
    
    NOTE:
        This option has no effect on the Mac.

Save:
    Create the QuickTime file with the current settings.
    
Cancel:
    Closes the window without saving the QuickTime movie.
