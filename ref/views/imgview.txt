= Image viewer interface =

The compositing viewer pane, IPR viewer pane, and MPlay application all
share the same basic image viewing interface.

The [image view|#image]  and [graph view|#graph]
can display up to 16 COPs at a time (in a 4x4 viewport layout). The
[timeline view|#timeline]  can display any number of COPs.


TIP:
    The  [IPR viewer pane|/ref/views/ipr]  cannot show multiple viewports at once. Otherwise, it uses the same image viewing interface. See  [how to use the IPR pane|/ref/views/ipr] for information on controls unique to the IPR pane.

== Work with images in the image viewer == (view)

:task:Choose the viewport layout (for Image and Graph views):
    On a compositing viewer's main toolbar, use the Layout menu to choose the number of columns and rows of viewports (for example, "2x2").

    If there are not enough sources to fill the viewports, Houdini will not show some rows or columns. To show all viewports regardless of whether they are blank or not,
    turn off the "Hide blank viewports" option at the bottom of the layout pop-up menu.

:task:Maximize a viewport:
    Move the mouse over the viewport and press ((T)). When a viewport is maximized, other viewports appear as tabs along the bottom of the viewer.
        
:task:Display the output of a compositing node (compositing viewer):
    Turn on the node's display flag. Shift-click the flag to turn it on without turning off the display flags of other nodes.

:task:View different planes:
    * Use the controls on the [control toolbar|#controltb] to switch between viewing
      full color, individual color channels, or alpha.

    * Press ((Shift + [)) and ((Shift + ])) to cycle through the
      planes in the image.

:task:View the full range of an HDR image:
    Click the Adapt to pixel range button on the  [control
    toolbar|#controltb]  or press ((Shift + R)).
    You can then use the color controls to fine tune the range
    you want to view.

:task:Work on a lower-resolution proxy image for better speed and memory usage:
    In the  [main toolbar|#maintb] , change the
    Proxy Resolution menu from Full to the resolution
    reduction you want (1/2, 1/4, etc).

    This affects all image sequences.

:task:Only update a sub-region of the image:
    Shift-drag a box around the region you want to focus on.
    Shift-click to clear the box and go back to updating the
    entire image.

    To home to the selected sub-region instead of the entire
    image, press ((G)) (Home selected centered at 100%) or
    ((Shift + G)) (Home selected to fit viewport).

:task:Perform color correction of the viewer image:
    * Use the sliders on the  [control toolbar|#controltb]  to adjust the color and gamma of the display.

    * To use a [look-up table|/composite/luts] , click the [Icon:IMAGE/lut_off] icon in the control bar From the menu. Choose __Load LUT__ and select the LUT through the file browser.

:task:Set the background image of the viewer:
    TIP:
        Use a background image in the viewer to help you judge opacity.
    
    # On the right toolbar, click the [Icon:BUTTONS/displayoptions] display options button to open the [Display Options window|/ref/windows/displayopts_image].

    # Use the controls on the __Background__ tab to load a background image.

      Transparency will automatically be enabled, as will double buffering (to avoid flicker).

    # To turn off the background image, open the display bar and
      turn off the [Icon:IMAGE/view_bgimage] Background Image button, or open the display options again and clear the filename.

== Analyze image problems in an image viewer == (analyze)

The image viewer has several ways to debug common image problems,
such as quantization and clipping.

=== View narrow color ranges ===

You may want to see more detail in an area of the image, such as
the shadows or highlights.

In the control toolbar, press the circular arrow button beside
the Brightness/Contrast controls. This will switch to the
alternate Black/White point controls.

For shadows, leave black at 0 and change white to a lower
number, like 0.1 or 0.2. You should be able to view the shadow
gradients in much more detail. All colors above the White point
will appear white.

For highlights, leave white at 1 and change the black point to
0.9 or so.

For HDR images, you may need to set black and white points
higher than 1. The easiest way to check the range is to click
the Adapt Pixel Range button on the far right of the control
toolbar. This will expand the black/white points to the min and
max values in the image. From there, you can narrow down a range
of color with the black/white point controls.

=== Inspect individual pixel values ===

Right click in the viewer and turn on "Inspect", or press ((I)) to enable the floating inspection box. As you move the pointer over the view, the box displays detailed information about what's under the cursor.

In the *image view*, the box displays pixel location and values. In the *timeline view*, it displays information about the sequence, frame, and filename. In the *graph view*, it displays information about the X/Y position under the cursor.

Val:
    Pixel values in 0-1 form.
Raw:
    Raw pixel values, as they are stored (0-255 for 8 bit
    values, 0-65535 for 16 bit values, and so on).
HSL:
    Hue, saturation, and luminance of the pixel.
Pix:
    Pixel coordinates of the mouse pointer.
uv:
    UV (0-1) coordinates of the mouse pointer.
LUT:
    Only displayed if the __Inspect LUT__ option on the
    __Correction__ tab of the [display options window|/ref/windows/displayopts_image] is on. Shows a reverse mapping of the
    value through the LUT. This is useful for Cineon LUTs, to
    see the original Cineon numbers.

=== Histograms ===

Use the image viewer's  [graph view|#graph]  to see
histograms of pixel values.

== Compare images in the image viewer == (compare)

# Show the [Difference toolbar|#difftb] if it's collapsed. Right-click in the image view and turn on __Diff__ in the context menu.

# Click the button menu at the left end of the toolbar to turn comparison on or off, or press ((Ctrl + D)).

# Right-click or press and hold on the button menu to choose the comparison method and source.

== Link and unlink viewports == (link)

When viewports are linked (on by default), changing a display option
will affect all viewports. Linked viewports are labeled in Yellow.
Unlinked viewports are labeled in white.

To link or unlink a viewport, move the mouse over the viewport and
press ((V)). You can also use the Apply Changes to All Views button
in the  [main toolbar|#maintb].

Options affected by linking are:

* Plane selector

* Display options (show guides, handles, previews, transparency,
  etc).

* Zoom buttons

* Color Correction controls (Component, Bright, Contrast, Gamma,
  LUT)

* Graph type

You can also link the viewing areas of viewports (off by default).
Panning or zooming in one viewport will affect all viewports, so
they show the same area. Press ((S)), or click Link Scrolling to all
Views at the right end of the main toolbar.

== Image viewer toolbars == (toolbars)

=== Main toolbar === (maintb)

[Icon:IMAGE/view_image] [Icon:IMAGE/view_timeline] [Icon:IMAGE/view_histogram]:

    area, hiding any other viewports. Click again to restore the
    viewport's original size and position.

[Icon:VIEW/display_applyto_current] / [Icon:VIEW/display_applyto_all]:
    When on, changing various controls, like the color
    correction and component controls, or the display item
    toggles, will affect all viewports. If off, only the current
    viewport is affected by these controls.

[Icon:IMAGE/viewport_linkscrolling]:
    When on, zooming or panning in one viewport will zoom and
    pan all viewports.

=== View toolbar ===

Exact Pixel Size:
    Always shows the image at actual size (100% scale),
    regardless of viewport size. This is automatically turned
    off if you manually zoom.

Clear Selection:
    Deselects any portion of the image has been selected (by
    ((RMB)) dragging).

Save Image:
    Lets you save the current viewport's current frame to a
    file.

Fit Viewport to Image (MPlay only):
    Shrinks or enlarges the MPlay window to fit the image. If
    more than one viewport is shown, resizes all viewports to
    the size of the largest viewport.

=== Display toolbar ===

[Icon:BUTTONS/displayoptions] (Houdini Only):
    Open the  [Display Options window|/ref/windows/displayopts_image]. Click again to hide the window.
    
[Icon:BUTTONS/switch] (Houdini Only):
    Turn this option off to disable updates of the viewport (the
    viewport will show black). Use this to speed up complex
    operations.
    
[Icon:IMAGE/view_labels]:
    Displays information in the top-left corner of the
    Viewport.
    
[Icon:IMAGE/view_handles] (Houdini only):
    Displays all handles.
    
[Icon:IMAGE/view_guides]:
    Shows gamuts and image border outline.
    
[Icon:IMAGE/view_preview]:
    Shows a small preview of the entire image in the bottom-left
    corner. In MPlay, you can click ((LMB)) in this preview to
    pan to that spot, and drag ((MMB)) to select the viewing
    region.

[Icon:IMAGE/view_rulers]:
    Displays rulers on the edges of the viewer to let you judge sizes and distances.

[Icon:IMAGE/view_alpha]:
    When on, shows alpha transparency of the image. Most useful
    when used in conjunction with a background image.
    
[Icon:IMAGE/view_bgimage]:
    When on, shows an image behind the current frame. Only
    visible if Transparency is on. Set the background image on
    the __Background__ tab of the [display options
    window|/ref/windows/displayopts_image].

    Maintains the original pixel aspect ratio when zooming.

[Icon:IMAGE/zoom_in]:
    Toggles the Magnify window, which shows the area under the
    mouse cursor zoomed 10x with inspection and HSV info.
    
=== Correction toolbar === (controltb)

    The Correction toolbar contains image component and color controls.
    
    [Icon:IMAGE/components_red]
    [Icon:IMAGE/components_green]
    [Icon:IMAGE/components_blue]
    [Icon:IMAGE/components_alpha]:
        These five buttons control which color plane(s) to show. The
        first icon shows all the planes (Red, Green, Blue,
        Alpha/Component 4). The next four turn the individual planes
        on or off.
    
        The Alpha/Component 4 button will show the fourth
        component plane if one exists, otherwise it shows the alpha
        channel.
    
        The default hotkeys for these buttons are ((~)), ((1)),
        ((2)), ((3)), and ((4)).
    
    [Icon:IMAGE/brightness] / [Icon:IMAGE/whitepoint] menu button:
        Switches between Brightness/Contrast controls and Black/White Points.
    
        Press ((R)) to reset all color correction controls to their default values.
    
    [Icon:IMAGE/brightness]:
        Click the brightness button to reset the brightness to 1.
    
        Enter a value in the number field for the brightness, or
        click ((MMB)) in the field to show a slider.
    
        The field turns yellow when brightness is not 1.
    
    [Icon:IMAGE/contrast]:
        Click the contrast button to reset the contrast to 1.
    
        Enter a value in the number field for the contrast, or click

        The field turns yellow when contrast is not 1.
    
    [Icon:IMAGE/bright_shift]:
        This value is added to all pixels, effectively shifting the
        brightness of the entire image up or down. This can be
        useful for looking through intensity "slices" of the image.
        
    [Icon:IMAGE/blackpoint]:
        The black point of the image, normally 0. This is applied
        after any image-specific white and black points, so 0 is
        always black and 1 is always white, regardless of the image
        data format.
        
    [Icon:IMAGE/whitepoint]:
        The white point of the image, normally 1. This is applied
        after any image-specific white and black points, so 0 is

    [Icon:IMAGE/adaptpixelrange]:
        Adjusts the black and white points to fit the minimum and
        maximum pixel values of the current image.
    
== Difference toolbar == (difftb)

The difference toolbar (((Ctrl + D))) lets you compare sequences
or frames.

Button menu:
    Click the button to turn comparison on or off. Right click the button or press and hold to open a menu of comparison types or choose a COP source to compare to.

    <!--
    Compare:
        TBD.
    -->
    
    Subtract:
        Subtracts the compare-to image from the current image.
        This will potentially produce negative values (use the
        __Adapt to Full Pixel Range__ button to view properly).
        
    Split Horizontal/Vertical:
        Shows the current image and compare-to image
        side-by-side. Use the blend factor to control how much
        of each image to show. MPlay only: click the image to
        set the split point.
        
    Blend:
        Blends the current and compared image together. Use the
        blend factor to control how much of each image to show
        (0 = only the current image, 1 = only the compare-to
        image, 0.5 = 50% of each, etc.).
        
    Highlight Differences:
        Highlights any pixels in the current image that differ
        from the compared image by more than the threshold set
        with the Blend factor. The default threshold is 0, so
        all differences will be highlighted. The threshold is
        measured in normalized color space (1 unit is equal to
        the range from black to white).

Blend factor:
    Controls how much of each image to show. Has different
    effects based on the comparison mode.

Current frame menu:
    Choose the frame from the image sequence to compare, such as
    the current frame, next frame, or a specific frame.

<!--
=== Operation controls toolbar ===

The selector toolbox can be used to select inputs and optionally
determine the planes to create.

The first half of the toolbox deals with input wiring, and is
common between the Generator and Filter Selectors. The text
prompt shows you the input label of the input you are currently
wiring. The pull down menu allows you to select any COP in your
current network. The next button completes the node creation and
places the node in the current viewport if pressed. The "X"
button removes the last wired input and allows you to re-wire
it.

The second half of the toolbox is specific to the Generator
Selector. If the toggle is off, none of the settings are applied
to the created node - its defaults are used instead.

The first menu selects which type of plane to create. The next
string field allows you to enter your own custom planes (For
example `foo{r,g,b}`. See the online help for the Generator
operators for more information). The next menu sets the
compositing operation to perform if the generator is doing Quick
Compositing. The last menu selects the data type for the plane.
-->

== Image view == (image)

In the main toolbar, click the [Icon:IMAGE/view_image] View Image mode button.

The Image viewer can display 8, 16 and 32 bit integer images,
floating point images, and deep rasters. You can view multiple
sequences simultaneously and compare them. The Image Viewer and the
standalone  [MPlay|/mplay/] , are very similar. Most of the
functions are identical.

The top two bars are only seen in Houdini - the top bar is the State
Controller, and the bar directly underneath it is the Toolbox
(currently showing the File COP toolbox). The next bar underneath
the toolbox is the main image control bar, which contains most of
the global functions to all image modes. The bar underneath that is
the Diff bar, used when comparing two images together.

Along the left side are the View Controls, which contains the size
adapt, zoom, home and PI buttons. Along the right side is the
Display Options, which contains the display item toggle buttons
(guides, transparency, background image, etc.).

Along the bottom is the Image Controls, which contains the Component
and Color correction controls. Above it is the Inspection bar, which
shows information on the pixel under the mouse cursor.

== Timeline view == (timeline)

In the main toolbar, click the [Icon:IMAGE/view_timeline] Timeline mode button.

Timeline view shows the sequences in a time graph for timing
analysis.

The timeline only has 1 viewport, which displays all the sequences
vertically on the timing graph. Single Images always appear in the
middle of the graph, as they exist everywhere.

Animated sequences have a start and an end.

The current frame range is shown as a black background. Anything
outside that range is grey. The sequence strips themselves have
squares in them, representing individual frames. Blue frames are
ones that exist (or aren't corrupt). Black frames indicate missing
frames. Bright blue frames indicate that a preview is visible at
that frame.

You can preview images on the strips. Houdini shows very small
thumbnails (less than 100x100) at regular intervals on the strip.
Press ((Ctrl + P)) to show the previews. Set the frequency of the
previews in the control toolbar (__Preview Every__)

=== Main toolbar ===

* The Resolution and Layout menus are not on the toolbar because
  they do not apply to the timeline view.

* the COP Filter button lets you choose which COP nodes to show
  (Displayed, Time Sensitive, or All).

=== Adapt toolbar ===

* When __Horizontal Adapt__ is on, the viewport automatically
  pans and zooms to show all sequence ranges.

* When __Vertical Adapt__ is on, the viewport automatically pans
  and zooms to show all sequences.

=== Control toolbar ===

Grid menu:
    Lets you choose display units (Frames or Seconds), and the
    grid density (none, low, medium, high).
Preview:
    Sets the rate at which previews appear in the sequence. Turn
    __previews__ on in the display toolbar to see the previews.
    
=== Display toolbar ===

Show preview:
    Shows preview thumbnails on the timelines. Set the interval
    between previews with the __Preview__ control on the Control
    toolbar.
Show frame boxes:
    Shows/hides boxes around the time a frame is visible.
Show extend regions:
    Shows regions controlled by Cycle, Mirror, Hold and Hold for
    N Frames conditions on the timeline.
Show timebar:
    Shows/hides a vertical blue line at the current time.
    
== Graph view == (graph)

In the main toolbar, click the [Icon:IMAGE/view_histogram] Graph mode button.

Graph view displays a variety of graphs and histograms based on the
pixel values of the image. It is useful for data analysis of images
(quantization, dynamic range, errors, etc.).

The graph view supports up to 16 viewports.

By default, the histograms don't adapt the entire range of the
graph; they clip off the top 2% of the maximum pixel occurrences.
This prevents the background color (which will probably be the most
prevalent color) from causing the graph to adapt to a single spike.
You can toggle this off by pressing ((Shift + S)) (or by clicking
"Ignore Graph Spikes during Adapt" at the bottom of the View
toolbar). This only applies to the first 4 histograms, not the
graphs.

=== Control toolbar ===

The control bar contains the same component selectors as the
Image view. There is also a menu to choose graph type:

Pixel Histogram:
    Frequencies of occurrence of pixel values in the image as a
    bar graph.
Hue Histogram:
    Frequencies of occurrence of hues in the image as a bar
    graph (you must have a vector plane of 3 or 4 elements).
Saturation Histogram:
    Frequencies of occurrence of saturation levels in the image
    as a bar graph.
Value Histogram:
    Frequencies of occurrence of pixel value levels in the image
    as a bar graph.
Pixel/Hue/Saturation/Value Vs U/V:
    These 8 graphs show the pixel value, hue, saturation or
    value of pixel rows or columns in the image. The values are
    plotted as individual points. Dense regions of the graph
    will appear more white than blue.
Hue Vs Saturation:
    Saturation range of the different hues in the image. Dense
    regions of the graph (ie, many occurrences of the same
    hue-saturation pair) will appear whiter than the normal
    hue.
Hue Vs Value:
    Value range of different hues in the image. Dense regions of
    the graph (ie, many occurrences of the same hue-saturation
    pair) will appear whiter than the normal hue.
    
=== Adapt toolbar ===

Horizontal Adapt:
    The viewport automatically pans and zooms to show the full
    horizontal domain of the graph.
Vertical Adapt:
    The viewport automatically pans and zooms to show the full
    vertical range of the graph.
Ignore Spikes During Adapt:
    Ignores the top 2% of data points when calculating the full
    vertical range of values for Vertical Adapt. This keeps
    spikes in the data from affecting the vertical range.
    
=== Graph types ===

Pixel Histogram:
    Shows the occurrence of pixel component values.
Hue Histogram:
    Shows the occurrence of the pixel hues.
Saturation Histogram:
    Shows the occurrence of pixel saturation.
Value Histogram:
    Shows the occurrence of pixel values (that is, level of
    brightness, as in hue, saturation, and value).
Color Curves:
    Shows the color transformation that the image is under. Only
    used in the COP viewer, for Blue Color correction nodes.
Pixel vs. U/V:
    Shows the pixel's values mapped along the Y axis, and the
    horizontal/vertical position along the X.
Hue/Saturation/Value vs. U/V:
    Same as above, but for hue, saturation, or value.
Hue vs. Saturation:
    Plots each hue's saturation, showing how saturated the
    various colors in the image are.
Hue vs. Value:
    Plots each hue's value, showing how bright the various
    colors in the image are.
