#helpid: h.pane.channeleditor
#subtopics_title: Views

The animation editor lets you view and edit animated parameters and how
Houdini fills in the transitions between keyframes. You can use the
[graph editor|changraph]  view (shows changes in parameter values over time as a graph), the [parameter table|chantable]  view (shows parameter values at
each keyframe in a table), or the [dopesheet|dopesheet]  view to edit animation. To switch between these views, use the pop-up menu at the top left of the pane.

== Tips ==

- You can click ((RMB)) on a channel group in the animation editor and choose __Motion Effects__ > __Create Clip__ to create a single [Channel CHOP|Node:chop/channel], moving all the channels in that group to it. Alternatively, if you have multiple channels in the channel list on the playbar, you can also do the same by right-clicking on the playbar.

- To create channel groups for a particular node, you can click ((RMB)) on the node in the Network View and choose __Create Nested Channel Groups__. 

- The animation editor can have a sub-pane containing a  [channel list|chanlist] . If you already have a channel list pane open, drag the divider divider left to hide the animation editor's channel list sub-pane.

== Function toolbar ==

All of the channels in Houdini are default bezier. The buttons on the function toolbar do not change the type of curve. For example, in earlier versions clicking the line button would set the mathematical equation for the channel to become linear. Now when you click the line button the curve will remain bezier and the handles will line up. 

NOTE:
    You can still change the type of curve by selecting a different one from __Function__ pop-up menu. 
    
== Frame range slider == (framerange)

The timeline slider below the graph controls the range of frames
displayed in the graph. Drag the left edge to change the first frame
shown in the graph. Drag the right edge to change the last frame
shown. Drag the middle to move the range along the timeline.

You can also type exact start and end frame numbers in the text
boxes on either side of the slider.
