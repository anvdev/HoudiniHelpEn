#helpid: h.pane.parmspreadsheet

= Parameter spreadsheet pane =

The parameter spreadsheet shows a flat list of rows representing nodes
in the network, and columns representing the flags and parameters (and
parameter components) of each node.

You can press ((RMB)) on a row heading to show a sub-set of that node's
context menu. Press ((RMB)) on a column heading to show options for the
column, such as sorting.

:task:Populate the spreadsheet:
    * Set the __Op mask__, __Op filter__, and __Parm mask__ fields
      in the toolbar. The fields support wildcards.

      The default is to not show anything (to prevent the
      spreadsheet from becoming overloaded with irrelevant
      information). For example, after you add nodes to the
      spreadsheet, it will not show any parameters on the rows. You
      must specify parameter names (such as `t*` for all parameters
      starting with t) in the __Parm mask__ field.

      You can use  [bundle|/basics/bundles] references in the __Op
      mask__ field (for example, `@arm_bones` to show all nodes in
      the `arm_bones` bundle).

    * Open the tree sub-pane (right click the background and turn on __Open parameter tree__, or press ((W)), or use the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu) and select nodes from the tree. Parameters and flags are also shown in the tree as a convenient drag source.

    * Drag nodes and/or parameters into the pane, or into the __Op
      mask__ or __Parm mask__ fields to add them.

    * Use __Load Scope__ from the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu to populate
      the spreadsheet with the parameters from the [Channel List|/anim/scope].

    * Drag a take into the pane to populate the spreadsheet with the
      nodes, parameters and flags currently in the take.

:task:Show flags in the spreadsheet:
    * Instead of using a parameter name in the __Parm mask__ field,
      use one of the following:
          * .display-flag
          * .render-flag
          * .template-flag
          * .footprint-flag
          * .selectable-flag
          * .export-flag

:task:Edit the value in a cell:
    * Click a cell to start editing the value inside.

:task:Select multiple cells:
    * Drag down the row headings (node paths) to select rows.

    * Drag across the column headings (parm names) to select
      columns.

    * Hold ((Space)) and click or drag to select multiple cells.

    * Press ((C)) to deselect any selected cells.

:task:Edit multiple cells at once:
    # Select the cells (see above).

    # Click in one of the cells and edit it.

    # When you press ((Enter)), the new value is copied to all
      selected cells.

NOTE:
    The pattern in the __Parm mask__ matches the _channel name_ of the
    parameter, _not_ the human-readable label from the parameter
    editor.

    To see the channel name of a parameter or parameter component, hold
    the mouse pointer over the parameter in the parameter editor. A
    tooltip will appear showing the channel name.


NOTE:
    Because the __Parm mask__ matches by name, the same pattern can
    match different parameters on different nodes. Some cells may be
    empty because the parameter in a column might exist on some nodes
    but not others.


NOTE:
    Empty rows, i.e. those without matching parameters, are excluded by
    default.  To change this, toggle __Show Empty Rows__ from the 
    [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu.


NOTE:
    Use the [parmsheet|Cmd:parmsheet] command to control the options of
    a parameter spreadsheet pane in HScript.

TIP:
    You can drag and drop a take from the [Take List|/ref/panes/takes] into the Parameter Spreadsheet to set the parm mask on the spreadsheet. This will let you quickly isolate the parms enabled in a given take and present them to you in a convenient, spreadsheet-like fashion for editing.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== A node I want does not appear in the spreadsheet. ===

* The node path does not match the pattern in __Op mask__.
    Check the pattern in the __Op mask__ field. See __Populate the spreadsheet__ above for how to add a node to the spreadsheet.

=== I can't edit a cell. ===

Possible causes and solutions:

* That parameter does not exist on that node.
    Cells at the intersection of a parameter (column) that does not exist on a given node (row) are empty. You cannot edit these cells.
    
* The parameter is locked.
    If the field's background color is pink, the parameter is locked. You can press ((RMB)) on the parameter's name in the parameter editor and choose __Unlock__ to unlock it.
    
* The parameter is not included in the current take.
    If the field has a dark background color (the same color as empty space in the pane), the parameter is not in the current take. You can press ((RMB)) on the parameter's name in the parameter editor and choose __Include In Take__ to include it in the current take.
