= Channel list =

The channel list is a dynamic list of channels that can react to node selection or be managed manually.

TIP:
    The channel list is also available as a sub-pane of the  [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] .

The Channel Group list shows all channel groups. Press ((RMB)) on a group to
see a context menu for the group.

The Channel List shows parameters of the selected objects and/or in the selected channel groups. Parameters in the channel list can be selected to perform operations on a sub-selection.

When you select objects, the channel list shows parameters of the object that either are keyed already, or are marked "auto-add". "Auto add" is a property of commonly-animated parameters that makes them automatically show up in the channel list. See [auto-add parameters|/anim/scope] and [Animation Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#anim]

In addition to the [value-editing techniques and shortcuts|/ref/panes/parms]  available in the parameter editor, you can also select multiple value boxes at once in the parameter list and type or use the ((MMB)) value ladder to change them all at once.

Press ((RMB)) in one of the sub-panes to show commands and options specific to the sub-pane. Press ((RMB)) on items in the lists to show commands and options for the item.
