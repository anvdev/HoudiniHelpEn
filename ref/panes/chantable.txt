= Table View =

The table view of the [animation editor|animeditor] lets you view channel values at keyframes.
You can also use the [graph view|changraph]
and the [dopesheet view|dopesheet]  to edit animation. To switch
between these views, use the buttons in the top left corner of the pane.

* Each column is a keyframe.

* The column heading shows the frame number.

* Each row is a parameter from the Channel List selection.

* The first column (with a purple heading) lists the parameter values at
  the current frame.

* Cells where a parameter has a keyframe are editable. Other cells are
  read-only and show the value for the parameter at that frame.

:task:Switch to viewing the functions that control interpolation between keyframes:
    Select __Edit Functions__ in the toolbar dropdown menu.

:task:Switch to viewing the parameter values at keyframes:

      want to key and the frame(s) you want to key at.

    # Choose __Edit > Key Selection__.

:task:Remove keys:
    # Select the keyframe cell(s).

    Values/Functions:
        Click to switch between viewing parameter values and the
        functions that control interpolation between keyframes.

== Channels menu == 

When a channel is displayed, it means that it is visible for viewing/editing in the animation editor's graph, table, and dopesheet panes. This status is also indicated by the colored background of the channel name in the channel list. Clicking on the colored background of the channel toggles its display status.

Set Keyframes at Current Time:
        Adds keyframes to the channels at the current time.

Sample Values at Current Time:
    Copies the values of the parameters at the current time
    to the clipboard. Move to a different time and choose __Paste
    sampled values at current time__ to use the same values at
    another frame.
    
Paste Sampled Values at Current Time:
    Pastes values copied with __Sample values at current time__.
    
Import into Displayed Parameters:
    Opens a dialog to load previously saved animation data from __Export Displayed Channels__ into the parameters which are currently displayed.

Export Displayed Channels as:
    This brings up a dialog that allows you to save the data from the displayed channels.
    
== Edit menu ==

Key Selection:
    Creates keyframes for the selected cells.

Delete Keys:
    Removes keys on the selected cells.

Copy:
    Copies the values of the selected cells to the clipboard.

Paste:
    Copies values from the clipboard into the selected cells.

    Pasting in the spreadsheet will _not_ delete keys if the pasted value is not a key. Pasting values _always_ creates a key at the target cell if one is not there already.
    
== Settings ==

Show Full Channel Path Names:
    If this option is turned on, the Channel column will show the full channel path (ie. include the node path as well) instead of just the channel name.

Show Channel Colors:
    If this option is turned on, the colored backgrounds behind the channel names/paths in the Channel column are displayed.

Reset Channels Settings:
    Resets all channel settings to their factory default settings.
