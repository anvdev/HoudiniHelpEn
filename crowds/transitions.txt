= Transition graphs =


== Overview ==

In response to some [trigger|triggers], the [Crowd Transition DOP|Node:dop/crowdtransition] switches the agent to new state, and switches the agent from playing the [clip|setup#clips] associated with the old state to playing the clip for the new state.

The Crowd Transition node has simple controls for blending between the animation clips of the "before" and "after" states. If you need more control (for example, waiting for a certain frame to start the transition, or transitioning through intermediate clips between the start and end clip), you can set up a _transition graph_.

A transition graph stores detailed information about how to transition between different clips. For example, the graph might specify that the `idle` -> `walk` clip transition should start at frame 16 and transition from the `idle` clip to the `idle_to_walk` clip, then to the `walk` clip.

Transition graphs are more work to set up, but give you much more control over transitions. If the default blended transitions look good enough at your level of detail, you don't need to bother with transition graphs.


== How to set up a transition graph ==

# After you load/generate the agent primitive in SOPs, append an [Agent Clip Transition Graph SOP|Node:sop/agentcliptransitiongraph] to the agent. Set up the different transitions in the parameters.

# In the crowd simulation network, on the [Crowd Object DOP|Node:dop/crowdobject], set the __Transition graph__ parameter to point to the Agent Clip Transition Graph SOP.

# On any [Crowd Transition DOPs|Node:dop/crowdtransition] for a state changes that should use the graph, turn on __Use clip transition graph__.


== Tips and notes ==

* The [Agent Clip Transition Graph SOP|Node:sop/agentcliptransitiongraph] stores the relationship graph as geometry, where points represent clips and polylines represent transitions, with data stored in attributes. This allows the possibility of creating your own custom tools to generate or edit the graph.
