"""How to set up obstacles for agents to avoid."""


== Overview == (oview)

You can specify static DOP objects for agents to avoid using a behavior. You can put this behavior _before_ the [behavior merge node|basics#network]


== Setting up static DOP objects as obstacles ==

# Make the obstacle object a [static object|/shelf/staticobject] in the crowd simulation.

# Select the obstacle object. On the __Crowds__ shelf tab, click [Icon:CROWDS/obstacle] Obstacle.

The shelf tool creates a [POP Steer Obstacle|Node:dop/popsteerobstacle] node, sets it to avoid the static object, and wires it after the `merge_states` node.

Because the POP Steer Obstacle is after the `merge_states` node, it applies to _all_ agents regardless of state. To make agents avoid an obstacle only in one state, move the POP Steer Obstacle node between the State node and the `merge_states` node. See [the crowd simulation network|setup#dops] and [states and behaviors|states] for more information.


== Tips and tricks ==

* Collisions and avoidance are calculated using the geometry bound to the character skeleton.
