== Reducing File Size ==

When saving a set of agent primitives to disk, their [shared agent definition(s)|agents#agentdefinition] are also embedded in the geometry file so that the agents can be reconstructed when the file is loaded.

Each component of the agent definition can be marked as an _external reference_ to a file on disk.
This occurs when, for example, when the [Agent SOP's|Node:sop/agent] __Input__ parameter is set to __Disk__, or when using the [Agent Clip SOP|Node:sop/agentclip] to load animation clips from disk.
In such cases, only the path to that file will be stored in the geometry file when saving out the agent definition (similar to a [packed disk primitive|/model/packed#disk]), which significantly reduces the size of the geometry files when saving a sequence of frames.
Otherwise, the contents of that component (such as the clip or shape library) will be embedded in the geometry file in the same manner as a [packed geometry primitive|/model/packed#memory].

TIP:
    Set the [Agent ROP's|Node:out/agent] __Source__ parameter to __Agent Primitive__ to write out the agent definition of an existing agent primitive to disk.


== Loading File Caches ==

When loading agents from a geometry file, the agent definition and any of its externally referenced files will also be read from disk.

If the agent definition does not contain external references, this may reduce performance when loading a sequence of files.
In addition to having to load larger files, having a separate copy of the agent definition in each file may cause slower viewport performance since the agent definition will appear to change each frame.

If the agent definition components are external references, Houdini is able to avoid reloading the agent definition files on each frame to improve performance.
Houdini maintains a reference-counted cache of agent definition files, so entries will be removed when no agent primitive in memory references those files.
This means that it is recommended to set the [File SOP's|Node:sop/file] __Cache Frames__ parameter to __at least 1__.
Otherwise, there can be unnecessary flushing and reloading of the agent definition files when the File SOP's geometry is cleared before loading the next file in the sequence.

TIP:
    For equivalent performance to viewing a cached sim from a DOP network, set the [File SOP's|Node:sop/file] __Cache Frames__ parameter to the number of simulation frames.
