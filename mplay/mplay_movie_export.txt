= Movie export from MPlay =

MPlay supports the creation of movie files from the loaded image sequence and audio.

When rendering with QuickTime, you can either render directly to MPlay or load your rendered sequence in MPlay. Once in MPlay, you can encode the image sequence into a movie file through __File > Export > QuickTime Movie__. 

:platform:Windows:
    - [QuickTime export window|/ref/windows/quicktime]
    - [FFmpeg|https://www.ffmpeg.org/index.html] is supported when ffmpeg.exe can be found via the PATH environment variable.

:platform:Mac:
    [QuickTime export window|/ref/windows/quicktime]

:platform:Linux:
    Linux movie export is implemented via external applications.   In 
    particular, if `ffmpeg` or `mencoder` are installed on the system and
    are found in the PATH environment variable, appropriate menu entries
    will be found in the __File > Export__ submenu.

    These external applications are registered via the `$HFS/houdini/MVexport`
    file.
