= Save images from MPlay =

:task:Save the sequence in the current viewport:
    * Choose __File > Save Sequence As__

:task:Save the sequence in a specific viewport:
    * Press ((RMB)) on the viewport and choose __Save__.

    * Select the sequence and click the __Save sequence__ button
      in the  [sequence list|mplay_sequence_dialog] .

The following save options are available in the file menu:

Save Frame As:
    Saves the image at the current frame.
Save Sequence As:
    Save the entire sequence, or a portion of the entire sequence. The
    `$F` variable should be used to specify the frame number location.
    Zero padding can be added to the frame numbers by specifying a digit
    right after the `$F` variable - `$F4` will always use at least 4
    digits (image0001.jpg).
Save Preview:
    Unlike the other two save methods, this saves the image exactly how
    it appears in the viewport, with all color corrections, the
    background image, cropping and proxy scaling applied (the pan and
    zoom is ignored). The image is always saved as an 8bit RGB image.
