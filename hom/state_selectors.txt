"""How to allow the user to select geometry as part of working with your SOP node state or to select objects with your OBJ node state ."""


== Overview ==

Often the workflow for a SOP filter node will allow the user to select components (such as polygons or points) for the node to work on. The tool may allow/require multiple selections, for example the "copy to points" tool takes the geometry to copy and the points to copy onto. These selections are then used to fill in "Group" parameters on the newly created node.

There are three ways to support selection for custom tools with Python states:

* [Manually script asking the user for each selection|#manual]. This is the traditional way that existing shelf tools work. We strongly suggest you use this method 

* [Bind persistent geometry selectors|#geo_selector]. This makes the active Python state ask for a selection. When the user completes a selection you can accept the selection by returning `True` from the `onSelection()` callback. One or many geometry selectors can be added. 

* [Bind persistent object selectors|#obj_selector]. Similar to geometry selectors but expect object selections instead. One or many object selectors can be added. 

* [Bind one or more entry selectors|#bindings]. This is similar to manually scripting selections. This method is currently not recommended.

* [Handle volatile selection|#vol_selection]. Support for accessing a volatile selection when a viewer state is active.

* [Handle existing selection|#existing_selection]. Support for accessing an existing selection when a viewer state is activated.


== Manually scripting selection == (manual)

This is traditional Houdini workflow where a shelf [tool script|tool_script] (usually embedded with the asset it creates) asks for the selections using HOM scripting, then uses utility functions to create the node, then enters the node's state.

See [tool script|tool_script] for more information on writing tool scripts. See [Python states and nodes|state_node] for more information on writing a custom Python state for an asset type.

== Binding a geometry selector ==

You can use [Hom:hou.ViewerStateTemplate#bindGeometrySelector] to bind a single SOP-level selector that runs when the viewer enters your custom SOP state. When the user completes a selection, Houdini calls your state's `onSelection()` callback method.

In the `onSelection()` method, you can get a `"selection"` item (a [Hom:hou.GeometrySelection] object) from the dictionary passed in. You can also get the current selector `"name"` from the dictionary. If you want to accept the selection, return `True` and the Houdini will end the selector and enter your state's regular operation. You can return `False` to reject the selection, and the selector will continue to run.

This may be useful for [nodeless states|state_nodeless], for example a state that lets you select components from the display geometry then displays information about them.

Houdini lets you bind multiple geometry selectors, use [Hom:hou.SceneViewer#triggerStateSelector] to start and stop individual selectors. Selectors are triggered by name which can be set at binding time.

{{{
#!python

class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

    def onSelection(self, kwargs):
        sel = kwargs["selection"]
        sel_name = kwargs["name"]
        if sel_name == "selector1":
            # Only accept the selection if it contains three polygons
            are_prims = sel.geometryType() == hou.geometryType.Primitive
            are_all_polys = all(pt == hou.primType.Polygon for pt in sel.primitiveTypes())
            selection = sel.selections()[0]
            count = selection.numSelected()

            return are_prims and are_all_polys and count == 3

        count = 0
        if sel_name == "selector2":
            # selector2 support
            selection = sel.selections()[0]
            count = selection.numSelected()
        return count > 0

template = hou.ViewerStateTemplate(
    "mystate.pystate", "My State",
    hou.sopNodeTypeCategory()

template.bindFactory(MyState)

# selector #1
template.bindGeometrySelector(
    name="selector1",
    prompt="Select three polygons",
    quick_select=False,

    prompt="Select a primitive",
    quick_select=True,
    geometry_types=hou.geometryType.Primitives
)

}}}

== Binding an object selector ==

You can use [Hom:hou.ViewerStateTemplate#bindObjectSelector] to bind a single OBJ-level selector that runs when the viewer enters your custom OBJ state. When the user completes a selection, Houdini calls your state's `onSelection()` callback method.

In the `onSelection()` method, you can get a `"selection"` item (a list of [Hom:hou.Node] objects) from the dictionary passed in. If you want to accept the selection, return `True` and the Houdini will end the selector and enter your state's regular operation. You can return `False` to reject the selection, and the selector will continue to run.

Houdini lets you bind multiple object selectors to your state, use [Hom:hou.SceneViewer#triggerStateSelector] to start and stop individual selectors. Selectors are triggered by name which can be set at binding time.

{{{
#!python

class MyOBJState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

    def onSelection(self, kwargs):
        cameras = kwargs["selection"]
        print "Number of cameras selected: ", len(cameras)

        return True


template = hou.ViewerStateTemplate("myOBJstate", "My OBJ State", hou.objNodeTypeCategory())
template.bindFactory(MyOBJState)

# Add a selector to select camera objects only
template.bindObjectSelector(
    prompt="Select camera object(s) and press Enter",
    quick_select=False,
    use_existing_selection=True,
    allowed_types=('*cam*',))
}}}

See the help for [Hom:hou.ViewerStateTemplate#bindObjectSelector] for information about the method's arguments.

== Binding entry selectors == (bindings)

*This method is currently not recommended*.

Theoretically, you can use [Hom:hou.ViewerStateTemplate#bindSelector] to bind one or more component selectors to your state, similar to using the `stateutils.Selector` objects and `stateutils.runSelectors()` in the script above. The state would run through these selectors and then let you create the node in the state's `onGenerate()` callback.

However, we recommend you manually script the selections and creating the node using utility functions as described above.

== Handle volatile selection == (vol_selection)

Volatile selection (i.e. selection via the `select` state) is supported with viewer states by simply 
implementing the `onSelection` handler. This is the same handler you would normally implement when 
binding a viewer state selector of a given [category|Hom:hou.NodeTypeCategory]. But there is no need to 
bind any selectors to support the volatile selection. Details about selection handlers can be found 
[here|python_states#selection_event_handlers]. 

When you terminate the volatile selection by tapping the `S` key, `onSelection` will be called with 
the selected elements as input. Optionally, you can implement the `onStartSelection` and `onStopSelection` 
handlers if you wish to get called when the volatile selector starts or terminates. 


== Handle existing selection == (existing_selection)
It is possible to access the current selection when a state is entered. If a selection already exists 
when the state is entered, Houdini will pass the selected element(s) to the `onSelection` handler and 
will consume the selection automatically. 

Like for a volatile selection, there is no need to bind a selector for handling an existing selection, 
just implementing `onSelection` will suffice. If one or more selectors are bound, Houdini will use 
either the `auto_start` selector or the first one set with `use_existing_selector=True`.
