"""Use this class to collect multiple redraws for any Python code block and only redraw once."""

@methods
::`__init__(self)`
    #cppname: HOM_RedrawBlock::HOM_RedrawBlock

    Construct a new RedrawBlock.

    The constructor should only be called from within a `with` statement.  For
    example:
    {{{
    #!python
    with hou.RedrawBlock() as redrawblock:
        #
        # Perform tasks
        #
    }}}

    All tasks within the code block will have their redraw requests collected
    and deferred until after the code in the block is complete.
    Once the code block is complete (or an exception causes a jump out of the 
    block), a single redraw per window with redraw requests will be performed.
    This cuts down on "redraw flickering" for a long set of commands.

    WARNING:
        Use care with Redraw Blocks. If an operation requires user interaction
        it should not be within a Redraw Block, otherwise the user will not see
        any prompts or the results of their actions.
