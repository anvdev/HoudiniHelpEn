"""Used to edit the current session overlay layer that is applied to the
current LOP node's scene graph."""

This object is a context manager. You can create one using
[Hom:hou.LopNetwork#viewportOverrides]. At the end of the `with` block, the
notification of the session edits is propagated to viewer panes.

@methods

::`layer(self)` -> `pxr.Sdf.Layer`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportOverrides::layer
    
    Return the `pxr.Sdf.Layer` object that contains all the current session
    edits to the scene graph. This object can be modified using the
    `pxr.Sdf.Layer` API to make further session modifications to the scene
    graph.

::`stage(self)` -> `pxr.Sdf.Stage`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportOverrides::stage
    
    Return the `pxr.Usd.Stage` object that contains all the current session
    edits to the scene graph. This object can be modified using the
    `pxr.Usd.Stage` API to make further session modifications to the scene
    graph.

::`setActive(self, prims, active)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportOverrides::setActive

    Change the active state of USD primitives by editing the session layer of
    a LOP Network. Deactivated primitives do not appear in the viewport, and
    cannot be expanded in the scene graph tree. The LOP Network to edit is
    determined by looking at the LOP node used to create this session editor
    object.

    prims:
        A [Hom:hou.LopSelectionRule] object that specifies which USD primitives
	should be affected.

    active:
	A boolean value indicating the new activation state of the USD
	primitives.

::`setDrawMode(self, prims, drawmode)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportOverrides::setDrawMode

    Change the draw mode of USD primitives by editing the session layer of
    a LOP Network. The draw mode of a primitive is only respected if the
    primitive is part of a valid, contiguous USD model hierarchy.  The LOP
    Network to edit is determined by looking at the LOP node used to create
    this session editor object.

    prims:
        A [Hom:hou.LopSelectionRule] object that specifies which USD primitives
	should be affected.

    drawmode:
	A string value indicating the new draw mode for the USD primitives.
	Only primitives that are part of a valid USD model hierarchy can have
	their draw mode changed. The allowed values for this string are
	`default` (draw the full geometry), `origin` (draw a set of axes at
	the origin of the primitive), `bounds` (draw a bounding box around the
	primitive), and `cards` (draw three axis-aligned cards that fill the
	primitive's bounding box).

::`setVisible(self, prims, visible)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportOverrides::setVisible

    Change the visibility of USD primitives by editing the session layer of
    a LOP Network. Invisible primitives are not drawn in the viewport, but
    still appear in the scene graph tree.  The LOP Network to edit is
    determined by looking at the LOP node used to create this session editor
    object.

    prims:
        A [Hom:hou.LopSelectionRule] object that specifies which USD primitives
	should be affected.

    visible:
	A boolean value indicating whether the USD primitives should be
	visible.
