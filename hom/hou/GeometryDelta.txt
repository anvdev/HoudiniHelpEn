"""Geometry delta provides access to the geometry differences (deltas) stored by some Geometry nodes such as the edit SOP."""

If you ask a SOP for its geometry delta via [Hom:hou.SopNode#geometryDelta], you'll get a reference to it.  If the SOP recooks, the corresponding geometry delta objects will update to the SOP's new geometry delta object.  If the SOP is deleted, accessing the geometry delta object will raise a [Hom:hou.ObjectWasDeleted] exception.

@methods

::`setPointPositionsFromString(self, positions)`:
    #cppname: HOM_GeometryDelta::setPointPositionsFromString
    Stores the differences between the provided positions and this SOP node's input geometry into this node's geometry delta object. This can be used, for example, to preload an edit SOP's delta so its output geometry matches a desired shape without changing the input geometry.

    The positions parameter should be a binary representation of the positions. For example, the result of calling [Hom:hou.Geometry#pointFloatAttribValuesAsString].
