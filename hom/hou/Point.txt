"""Each Point object resides inside a Geometry object and stores a
3D position.  Points may be shared between primitives (such as polygons), and
the set of points and primitives describes a 3D shape."""

The set of points may also store arbitrary data in the form of attributes,
and each point instance stores a unique attribute value.

@methods

::`attribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `int`, `float`, `str` or `tuple`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::attribValue
    #replaces: Exp:point, Exp:points, Exp:poppoint, Exp:poppointid
    Return value stored in this point for a particular attribute.  The
    attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.

    Looking up an attribute value using a [Hom:hou.Attrib] object is slightly
    faster than looking it up by name.  When looking up attribute values inside
    a loop, look up the [Hom:hou.Attrib] object outside the loop, and pass it
    into this method.

    Note that the point position attribute is named `P` and is 4 floats in size.
    This attribute always exists.

    When looking up the attribute values of all points, it is faster to call
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#pointFloatAttribValues] or
    [Hom:hou.Geometry#pointFloatAttribValuesAsString] than to call this method
    for each point in the geometry.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name.

    {{{
    #!python
    # Create an object containing two SOPs: a box SOP wired into a color SOP.
    geo_node = hou.node("/obj").createNode("geo")
    box = geo_node.createNode("box")
    color = geo_node.createNode("color")
    color.setFirstInput(box)

    # Grab the color SOP's geometry, get its first point, and print out the
    # value of the Cd attribute.
    geo = color.geometry()
    point = geo.iterPoints()[0]
    print point.attribValue("Cd")

    # Look up the Cd attribute and illustrate how to access the attribute
    # value using the attribute object.
    cd_attribute = geo.findPointAttrib("Cd")
    print point.attribValue(cd_attribute)
    }}}

::`floatAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::floatAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular floating point attribute.
    The attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name
    or the attribute is not float of size 1.

    In most cases, you'll just use [Hom:hou.Point#attribValue] to access
    attribute values.  Houdini uses this method internally to implement
    attribValue.

::`floatListAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `tuple` of `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::floatListAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular floating point
    attribute.  The attribute may be specified by name or by
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  The return value is a tuple of floats.

    It is valid to call this method when the attribute's size is 1.  In this
    case, a tuple with one element is returned.

    See also [Hom:hou.Point#attribValue].

::`intAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::intAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular integer
    attribute of size 1.  The attribute may be specified by name or by
    [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  See [Hom:hou.Point#floatAttribValue] for more
    information.

::`intListAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `tuple` of `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::intListAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular integer attribute.  The
    attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  The
    return value is a tuple of ints.  See [Hom:hou.Point#floatListAttribValue]
    for more information.

::`stringAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::stringAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular string attribute.  The
    attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  See
    [Hom:hou.Point#floatAttribValue] for more information.

::`stringListAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::stringListAttribValue
    Return the point attribute value for a particular string attribute.  The
    attribute may be specified by name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object.  The
    return value is a tuple of strings.

    It is valid to call this method when the attribute's size is 1.  In this
    case, a tuple with one element is returned.

    See also [Hom:hou.Point#attribValue].

::`position(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Vector3]:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::position
    Return the position of this point as a Vector3 containing the (X, Y, Z)
    position values.
    
    This method is a shortcut for accessing the `P` attribute of the point.
    {{{
    #!python
    point.position()
    # is equivalent to
    hou.Vector3(point.attribValue("P"))
    }}}
    
    Because the position is returned as a Vector3, it can be accessed as
    a sequence.  However, you can also easily use [Hom:hou.Matrix4] to
    transform the position.

    - [Hom:hou.Point#weight]
    - [Hom:hou.Vector3]
    - [Hom:hou.Matrix4]

::`weight(self)` -> `float`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::weight
    Return the weight of this point.  Point weights are displayed in Houdini's
    geometry spreadsheet as the fourth component of the position, and are
    used in NURBS curves and surfaces.

    Most of the time, the weight is 1.0.

    This method is a shortcut for accessing the `Pw` attribute of the point.
    {{{
    #!python
    point.weight()
    # is equivalent to
    point.attribValue("Pw")
    }}}

    You can build a [Hom:hou.Vector4] containing both the position and weight
    as follows:
    {{{
    #!python
    hou.Vector4(tuple(point.position()) + (point.weight(),))
    }}}

    See also [Hom:hou.Point#position].

::`setAttribValue(self, name_or_attrib, attrib_value)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::setAttribValue
    Store an attribute value in this point.  The attribute may be specified by
    name or by [Hom:hou.Attrib] object, and must be an existing point attribute
    in the geometry.  You would typically call this method from the code of a
    Python-defined SOP.

    Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if no attribute exists with this name
    or if the attribute's data type does not match the value passed in.  If the
    attribute's size is more than 1, the attribute value must be a sequence of
    integers/floats, and the size of the sequence must match the attribute's
    size.

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if this geometry is not modifiable.

    See [Hom:hou.Geometry#addAttrib] for an example.

    See also:
    - [Hom:hou.Prim#setAttribValue]
    - [Hom:hou.Vertex#setAttribValue]
    - [Hom:hou.Geometry#setGlobalAttribValue]

::`setPosition(self, position)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::setPosition
    Changes the point's location.  You would typically call this method from
    the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    position:
	Any sequence of floats, such has a [Hom:hou.Vector3] or a tuple of
	floats, of length either 3 or 4.  The fourth coordinate corresponds to
	the weight, and is usually 1.  The weight is typically used by NURBS
	curves and sequences.  If the sequence is of size 3, the weight will be
	unchanged.

    This method is a shortcut for calling [Hom:hou.Point#setAttribValue] on
    the `P` attribute.

    {{{
    #!python
    point.setPosition((x, y, z))
    # is the same as
    point.setAttribValue("P", (x, y, z))
    }}}

    Raises [Hom:hou.GeometryPermissionError] if the geometry is not modifiable.
    Raises [Hom:hou.InvalidSize] if the length of `position` is not 3.

    See also [Hom:hou.Point#setWeight].

::`setWeight(self, weight)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::setWeight
    Change the point's weight.  You would typically call this method from
    the code of a Python-defined SOP.

    This method is a shortcut for calling [Hom:hou.Point#setAttribValue] on
    the `Pw` attribute.

    See [Hom:hou.Point#weight] for more information about a point's weight.
    See also [Hom:hou.Point#setPosition].

::`attribType(self)` -> [Hom:hou.attribType] enum value:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::attribType
    Return the enumerated value [Hom:hou.attribType#Point].  Points,
    primitives, vertices, and geometry support the same set of methods for
    querying their attributes, and this method is one of them.

    See also:
    - [Hom:hou.Prim#attribType]
    - [Hom:hou.Vertex#attribType]
    - [Hom:hou.Geometry#attribType]
    - [Hom:hou.attribType]

::`geometry(self)` -> [Hom:hou.Geometry]:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::geometry
    Return the [Hom:hou.Geometry] object containing this point.

::`number(self)` -> `int`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::number
    #replaces: Exp:pointlist, Exp:poppointnum
    Return the number of this point.  Points are numbered sequentially
    starting from 0, and the points returned by [Hom:hou.Geometry#points]
    are in order by their number.

::`prims(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Prim]:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::prims
    Returns a tuple of the primitives that reference this point.

::`vertices(self)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Vertex]:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::vertices
    Returns a tuple of the vertices that reference this point.  Note that this
    requires a search through a primitive's vertices, so the cost is linear in
    the total number of vertices in these primitives.

::`transform(self, matrix)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::transform
    #status: ni

::`destroy(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_Point::destroy
