"""A deformer for agent shapes."""

Agent shape deformers are used to provide different deformation methods for shapes, such as linear skinning or dual quaternion skinning.
Each [shape binding|Hom:hou.AgentShapeBinding] can specify the deformer that should be used.
The [Hom:hou.crowds#shapeDeformers] method provides a list of the available deformers. 

@methods

::`name(self)` -> `str`
    #cppname: HOM_AgentShapeDeformer::name

    Returns the unique name for the deformer.
