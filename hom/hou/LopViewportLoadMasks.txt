@methods

::`__init__(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks
    Create a LopViewportLoadMasks object with default settings. This object
    describes various options for controlling which primitives and layers
    are composed together on the stage that is visible in the viewport.
    This object allows for the control of the stage population mask, the
    loading of payload primitives, and the muting of layers from disk.
    The default settings populate and load all primitives and layers.

::`populateAll(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::populateAll
    Returns `True` if the stage mask is configured to include the entire
    scene graph. If `True`, the explicit list of paths has no meaning.

::`setPopulateAll(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::setPopulateAll
    Configures the stage mask to include the entire scene graph. This clears
    the current list of paths to populate because it is not needed.
    Calling any method which manipulates the list of paths to populate will
    set this flag back to `False`.

::`isPathPopulated(self, path, exact_match = True)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::isPathLoaded
    Return `True` if the specified scene graph path is explicitly named in the
    list of paths to populate. If `exact_match` is `False`, this method also
    returns true if any ancestor of the supplied path is in the set of
    paths to populate.

::`populatePaths(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::populatePaths
    Return the list of all paths which should be populated on the stage.
    Descendants of explicitly named primitives will also populate on the
    stage.

::`setPopulatePaths(self, paths)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::setPopulatePaths
    Set the list of paths which should be populated on the stage.

::`addPopulatePath(self, path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::addPopulatePath
    Adds a single path to the list of paths to populate. If the path is already
    in the list of paths, this method does nothing.

::`removePopulatePath(self, path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::removePopulatePath
    Removes a single path from the list of paths to populate . If the path is
    not in the list of paths, this method does nothing.

::`isLayerMuted(self, identifier)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::isLayerMuted
    Return `True` if the specified layer identifier should be ignored when
    composing the stage. 

::`muteLayers(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::muteLayers
    Return the list of all muted layer identifiers.

::`setMuteLayers(self, identifiers)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::setMuteLayers
    Set the list of layer identifiers that should be muted.

::`addMuteLayer(self, identifier)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::addMuteLayer
    Adds a single layer identifier to the list of muted layer identifiers. If
    the identifier is already being muted, this method does nothing.

::`removeMuteLayer(self, identifier)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::removeMuteLayer
    Removes a single layer identifier from the list of muted layer
    identifiers. If the identifier is not being muted, this method does
    nothing.

::`loadAll(self)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::loadAllPaths
    Return `True` if all payloads should be loaded by default.

::`setLoadAll(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::setLoadAll
    Set the flag indicating that all payloads should be loaded by default.
    Calling any method which manipulates the list of paths to be loaded will
    set this flag back to `False`.

::`isPathLoaded(self, path, exact_match = True)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::isPathLoaded
    Return `True` if the specified scene graph path is explicitly named in the
    list of paths to load. If `exact_match` is `False`, this method also
    returns true if any ancestor of the supplied path is in the set of
    paths to load.

::`loadPaths(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::loadPaths
    Return a list of all scene graph branches which will load their payloads
    in the viewport. Descendants of explicitly named primitives will also load
    their payloads.

::`setLoadPaths(self, paths)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::setLoadPaths
    Set the list of scene graph paths which should load their payloads in the
    viewport.

::`addLoadPath(self, path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::addLoadPath
    Adds a single path to the list of scene graph paths which will load their
    payloads inthe viewport. If the path is already in the list, this method
    does nothing.

::`removeLoadPath(self, path)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopViewportLoadMasks::removeLoadPath
    Removes a single path from the list of scene graph paths which will load
    their payloads in the viewport. If the path is not in the list, this method
    does nothing.
