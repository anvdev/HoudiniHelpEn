:usage: `skipClosingMenusForCurrentButtonPress()`
    
Normally a mouse button event sent to any Qt widget in the Houdini process
will cause all open Houdini menus to close. However if a mouse button
event to a Qt widget is what causes a Houdini menu to open (such as
through a call to [Hom:hou.NetworkEditor.openNodeMenu]), it is necessary
to disable this automatic menu closing temporarily. Otherwise the menu
that was just opened would be immediately closed. This method does exactly
this, disabling the automatic menu closing until the next mouse button
release event, at which time the automatic menu closing is re-enabled.
