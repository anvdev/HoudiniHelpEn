    #cppname: HOM_qt_HelpButton::HOM_qt_HelpButton
    Create and return a new help button that opens the given help when clicked.
    
    `help_path` must be a recognized help path.  For example, set `help_path`
    to "/nodes/sop/torus" to open the Torus SOP help when the button is
    clicked.

    You can optionally set `tooltip` to add hover tooltip text to the button.
