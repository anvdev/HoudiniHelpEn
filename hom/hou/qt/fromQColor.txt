"""Convert the given QColor to a HOM color and alpha value."""

:usage: `fromQColor(qcolor)` -> `[Hom:hou.Color], float`

Convert the given QColor, `qcolor`, to a [Hom:hou.Color] and alpha value
and return the [Hom:hou.Color] and alpha as a 2-tuple.

Note that [Hom:hou.Color] does not store an alpha which is why the alpha
is returned separately.
