"""A collection of gallery entries that can be applied to operator nodes 
to set their parameters to predefined values."""

In Houdini, a gallery is a collection of node templates and their parameter 
presets, which are represented by a [Hom:hou.GalleryEntry].
A gallery corresponds to a file where such templates are saved. Galleries can be
managed with a [Hom:hou.galleries] module.

@methods

::`createEntry(self, entry_name, node=None)` -> [Hom:hou.GalleryEntry]:
    #cppname: HOM_GalleryEntry::createEntry
    Create and return a new gallery entry.

    entry_name:
	The name of the new gallery entry.

    node:
	The operator node from which the new gallery entry should copy the
	settings. The settings include parameter values, channels, spare
	parameters etc, and also the children nodes if the node is a subnetwork.

::`deleteEntry(self, entry_name)`:
    #cppname: HOM_GalleryEntry::deleteEntry
    Delete an entry from the gallery.

    entry_name:
	The name of the gallery entry to be deleted.

::`galleryEntries(self, name_pattern=None, label_pattern=None, keyword_pattern=None, category=None, node_type=None)` -> tuple of [Hom:hou.GalleryEntry]:
    #cppname: HOM_Gallery::galleryEntries
    Return a tuple of entries that are stored in the gallery.
    See also [Hom:hou.galleries#galleryEntries].

    name_pattern:
	A pattern that the gallery entry name must match to be included
	in the returned tuple. The pattern can contain '?' to match a single 
	character, '*' to match any number of characters, and '\[char_set\]' 
	to match any character in the set. 
	If `None`, all gallery entries are considered to match it.

    label_pattern:
	A pattern that the gallery entry label must match to be included
	in the returned tuple. See the `name_pattern` above for special
	characters in the pattern.
	If `None`, all gallery entries are considered to match it.

    keyword_pattern:
	A pattern that any of the gallery entry keywords needs to match 
	for the entry to be included in the returned tuple. 
	See the `name_pattern` above for special characters in the pattern.
	If `None`, all gallery entries are considered to match it.

    category:
	If not `None`, only gallery entries in the specified category
	will be included in the returned tuple.
	
    node_type:
	If not `None`, only gallery entries for a given node type will
	be included in the returned tuple.
