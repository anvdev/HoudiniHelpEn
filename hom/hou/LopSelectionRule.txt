@methods

::`__init__(self)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopSelectionRule::HOM_LopSelectionRule
    Create an LopSelectionRule object with default settings.

::`collectionAwarePaths(self, lopnode)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopSelectionRule::collectionAwarePaths
    Calculates the scene graph primitive selection using the scene graph from
    the provided [Hom:hou.LopNode|LOP node] object.

    Returns the full paths to every scene graph primitive or collection
    matching the selection pattern. Unlike the `expandedPaths` method,
    collections are not expanded to explicitly list their contents as
    primitives. Instead the full path of the collection itself is returned.

    If the primitive pattern contains any exclusions the included collections
    cannot be accurately tracked, so the results of this method will be the
    same as for `expandedPaths`.

::`expandedPaths(self, lopnode)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopSelectionRule::expandedPaths
    Calculates the scene graph primitive selection using the scene graph from
    the provided [Hom:hou.LopNode|LOP node] object.

    Returns the full paths to every scene graph primitive matching the
    selection rules. All collections in the path pattern are expanded to
    list their included prims explicitly.

::`pathPattern(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopSelectionRule::pathPattern
    Return the path pattern string used in this selection rule.

::`setPathPattern(self, pattern)`:
    #cppname: HOM_LopSelectionRule::setPathPattern
    Sets the path pattern string used in this selection rule.
