@values

:: Normal
    A standard menu that displays the currently selected menu item.
:: Mini
    A condensed menu that only displays a dropdown arrow.  Houdini lets you
    choose a menu entry when you click on this arrow.
:: ControlNextParameter
    A standard menu that displays the currently selected menu item. This menu
    always joins horizontally to the next parameter and is displayed without a
    label. However unlike simply turning off the label and joining to the next
    parameter, the layout of the next parameter is such that a series of
    parameters preceded by menus of this type will align in a much more
    appealing way.
:: StringReplace
    A menu that also displays an input field.  Selecting an entry from this
    menu will replace the contents of the field with the menu item.  This
    type of menu only has meaning for string parameters.
:: StringToggle
    A menu that also displays an input field.  Selecting an entry from this
    menu will add the menu item to the field if it was not already there, and
    will remove it from the field it if was.  This type of menu only has
    meaning for string parameters.
