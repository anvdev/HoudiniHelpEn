"""Viewport highlight of primitives with selected components"""

When components of a primitive are selected (points, vertices, edges), the primitive can be highlighted as well to indicate which primitives will be affected by the current selection.

@values

::hou.viewportClosureSelection.Hide: 
    Primitives are not highlighted.
::hou.viewportClosureSelection.HullPrimitives: 
    Only primitives whose points and edges reside on separate hull geometry will be highlighted when those are selected (NURBS surfaces, Bezier surfaces).
::hou.viewportClosureSelection.Show: 
    Highlight all primitives whose points, edges, or vertices belong to the current selection.
