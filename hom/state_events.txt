"""How to listen for and respond to direct UI input."""


== Overview ==

(See [Python states|python_states] for the basics of how to implement a custom viewer state.)

The standard way to allow user interaction with a node is to [bind handles|state_handles] to node parameters in a node's state. Handles can be very powerful on their own, letting you specify a ready-made user interface for a wide variety of parameter setups.

However, sometimes you want the ability to interpret lower-level user input such as mouse moves, button presses, mouse wheel clicks, tablet tilt and pressure, and so on. You can implement the `onMouseEvent()` callback 

* 

* While your state is active, in your mouse event handler you can get a _ray_ (a directional line) from the mouse "into" the screen. You can intersect this [pointing ray|#ray] with the geometry to know what is under the mouse pointer at that moment.

* To set up a right-click context menu for your custom state, see [Python state menu|state_menus].

* The [UI device object|#device] has useful methods for detecting modifier keys and arrow keys. For information on capturing hotkeys, see [Python state menu hotkeys|state_menus#hotkeys]


== Input events ==

The Python state implementation supports the following callback methods:

Method ||
    Called for ||

`onKeyEvent` |
    keyboard events |
        See [reading the keyboard device|#keybdevice] below.

`onMouseEvent` |
    input device moves/clicks |
        See [reading the UI device|#device] below.

`onMouseWheelEvent` |
    mouse wheel scroll |
        See [scroll wheel|#wheel] below.

The UIEvent object you get from the `"ui_event"` key of the dictionary passed to these callbacks has two useful methods: [Hom:hou.UIEvent#device] returns a [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] object that lets you read the state of the user input device. [Hom:hou.UIEvent#ray] returns a [pointing ray|#ray] into the 3D scene.


== Reading the UI input device == (device)

The [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] returned by `kwargs["ui_event"].device()` in a UI event handler contains methods for getting the screen coordinates of the mouse within the view, the state of the mouse buttons and modifier keys, and also [tablet-specific data|#tablet].

See the help for [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] to see what data is available.

{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function


class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

    def onMouseWheelEvent(self, kwargs):
        # Get the UI envent
        ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
        # Get the UI device object
        device = ui_event.device()

        print("Screen X=", device.mouseX())
        print("Screen Y=", device.mouseY())
        print("LMB pressed=", device.isLeftButton())
        print("MMB pressed=", device.isMiddleButton())
        print("RMB pressed=", device.isRightButton())
        print("Shift pressed=", device.isShiftKey())
        print("Ctrl pressed=", device.isCtrlKey())
        print("Alt/option pressed=", device.isAltKey())
}}}


== Left mouse button == (reason)

Instead of storing whether the left mouse button was pressed (using `device.isLeftButton()`) in the last event and comparing it to the current event to see if the mouse was pressed or dragged or released, you can call [Hom:hou.UIEvent#reason] and check the [Hom:hou.uiEventReason] value.

{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function


def onMouseEvent(self, kwargs):
    ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
    reason = ui_event.reason()
    if reason == hou.uiEventReason.Picked:
        print("LMB click")

    elif reason == hou.uiEventReason.Start:
        print("LMB was pressed down")

    elif reason == hou.uiEventReason.Active:
        print("Mouse dragged with LMB down")

    elif reason == hou.uiEventReason.Changed:
        print("LMB was released")

}}}

Other than mouse clicks/drags, the usual reason returned will be `hou.uiEventReason.Located` for a mouse move.


== Mouse wheel == (wheel)

If the user scrolls the mouse wheel vertically, Houdini calls your state's `onMouseWheelEvent()` method (if it exists). You can then read the scroll value from the [device|#device] using [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice#mouseWheel].

This API does not currently support scoll axes other than vertical.

{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function


class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

    def onMouseWheelEvent(self, kwargs):
        # Get the UI device object
        device = kwargs["ui_event"].device()
        scroll = device.mouseWheel()
        print("Scroll=", scroll)
}}}

See the help for [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice#mouseWheel] for information about the number returned.

== Reading the keyboard device == (keybdevice)

The `onKeyEvent` handler let you process keyboard events such as single and modifier keys. The [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] returned by `kwargs["ui_event"].device()` gives access to the key being pressed and other useful 
information about the event.

{{{
#!python
def onKeyEvent(self, kwargs):
    ui_event = kwargs['ui_event']

    # Log some key event info in the Viewer State Browser console
    self.trace( ui_event.device().keyString(), name='key string' )
    self.trace( ui_event.device().keyValue(), name='key value' )
    self.trace( ui_event.device().isAutoRepeat(), name='isAutoRepeat' )

    # Use the key string to decide if the event should be consumed or not.
    # Store the pressed key for use in other handlers.
    self.key_pressed = ui_event.device().keyString()
    if self.key_pressed in ('a', 'shift a', 'ctrl g'):
        # returns True to consume the event
        return True

    # Consume the event only if the 'f', 'p' or 'v' key is held
    if ui_event.device().isAutoRepeat():            
        ascii_key = ui_event.device().keyValue()
        if ascii_key in (102, 112, 118):
            self.key_pressed = ui_event.device().keyString()
            return True

    self.key_pressed = None

    # return False if the event is not consumed
    return False
}}}

== Tablet ==

The [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] returned by `kwargs["ui_event"].device()` in a UI event handler lets you check whether the user is using a tablet, and read tablet-specific intput data.

See the help for [Hom:hou.UIEventDevice] to see what tablet-specific data is available.

{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function


class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

    def onMouseWheelEvent(self, kwargs):
        # Get the UI envent
        ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
        # Get the UI device object
        device = ui_event.device()

        print("Screen X=", device.mouseX())
        print("Screen Y=", device.mouseY())
        print("LMB pressed=", device.isLeftButton())
        print("MMB pressed=", device.isMiddleButton())
        print("RMB pressed=", device.isRightButton())
        print("Shift pressed=", device.isShiftKey())
        print("Ctrl pressed=", device.isCtrlKey())
        print("Alt/option pressed=", device.isAltKey())

        if device.isTablet():
            print("Angle=", device.tabletAngle())
            print("Pressure=", device.tabletPressure())
            print("Roll=", device.tabletRoll())
            print("Tilt=", device.tabletTilt())
}}}


== Getting the pointing ray == (ray)

* In the `onMouseEvent` handler, you can get a reference to the [Hom:hou.ViewerEvent] object using `kwargs["ui_event"]`, and then call [Hom:hou.ViewerEvent#ray] to get a world-space origin and direction vector representing a "pointing ray" firing from the mouse pointer "into" the scene. You can use this to tell what's under the mouse pointer in the 3D scene.

    {{{
    #!python
    class MyState(object):
        def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
            self.state_name = state_name
            self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer

        def onMouseEvent(self, kwargs):
            ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
            origin, direction = ui_event.ray()
    }}}

* If you want the pointing ray to *take the current snapping controls into account*, use [Hom:hou.ViewerEvent#snappingRay] instead of `ray()`. This method returns a tuple of `(ray_origin, ray_direction, snapped)`, where the third item is a boolean indicating whether the ray was snapped.


== Intersecting geometry == (geo)

You can check what geometry is under the pointer using [Hom:hou.Geometry#intersect]. This method is a bit unusual in that it requires setting up C-style "output arguments". You can make it slightly easier to use by wrapping it in a utility function:

{{{
#!python

# In viewerstate.utils
def sopGeometryIntersection(geometry, ray_origin, ray_dir):
    # Make objects for the intersect() method to modify
    position = hou.Vector3()
    normal = hou.Vector3()
    uvw = hou.Vector3()
    # Try intersecting the ray with the geometry
    intersected = geometry.intersect(
        ray_origin, ray_dir, position, normal, uvw
    )
    # Returns a tuple of four values:
    # - the primitive number of the primitive hit, or -1 if the ray didn't hit
    # - the 3D position of the intersection point (as Vector3)
    # - the normal of the ray to the hit primitive (as Vector3)
    # - the uvw coordinates of the intersection on the primitive (as Vector3)
    return intersected, position, normal, uvw
}}}

This function takes a [Hom:hou.Geometry] object, the ray origin, and the ray direction. You get the ray origin and direction from `kwargs["ui_event"].ray()` (see [above|#ray]). For the geometry, you should generally use the _current node's input geometry_.

TIP:
    *You should get a single reference to the geometry and hold onto it* rather than getting the geometry separately in each `onMouseEvent()`.

    The reason is Houdini builds acceleration structures to make intersection faster when you call `Geometry.intersect()`. If you keep one reference to the geometry, you only pay this cost once, whereas if you get a new `Geometry` reference in each event, you have to pay this cost over and over, leading to slow performance.

{{{
#!python
class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer
        self._geometry = None

    def onEnter(self, kwargs):
        node = kwargs["node"]
        if inputs and inputs[0]:
            self._geometry = inputs[0].geometry()

    def onMouseEvent(self, kwargs):
        node = kwargs["node"]
        ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
        ray_origin, ray_dir = ui_event.ray()

        if self._geometry:
            hit, pos, norm, uvw = sopGeometryIntersection(
                self._geometry, ray_origin, ray_dir
            )
            # ...
}}}

Depending on the type of state you create, you might want to intersect a different geometry. For example, in an "inspector" state (not tied to a node), you might want to intersect the display geometry:

{{{
#!python
from stateutils import ancestorObject

network = ancestorObject(scene_viewer.pwd())
geometry = network.displayNode().geometry()
}}}

The `sopGeometryIntersection` function returns a tuple of four items:

Type ||
    Content ||

`int` |
    An integer representing the primitive number of the primitive hit by the ray. If the ray missed the geometry, this is `-1`.

[Hom:hou.Vector3] |
    The 3D coordinates of the intersection point.

[Hom:hou.Vector3] |
    The direction of the ray relative to the surface of the hit primitive at the intersection point.

[Hom:hou.Vector3] |
    The U, V (and W) coordinates of the intersection point across the surface of the hit primitive.

(If the ray missed, the three vectors are left at their defaults: `0, 0, 0`.)

See [flexible intersection|#flex] below for how to combine geometry intersection with construction plane intersection.


== Interacting with the intersected primitive ==

* If the first number returned by `sopGeometryIntersection()` is not `-1`, it is a primitive number. You can get a [Hom:hou.Prim] object for that primitive using [Hom:hou.Geometry#prim].

* The object you get will often be a more specialized _subclass_ of `Prim`. For example, if you ask for a polygon primitive, you will get a [Hom:hou.Polygon] object.

    The best way to check what kind of primitive you have is to call [Hom:hou.Prim#type] and check what kind of [Hom:hou.primType] value it returns.

    {{{
    #!python
    prim = geometry.prim(prim_num)
    if prim.type() != hou.primType.Polygon:
        raise hou.Error("This tool only works with polygons")
    }}}

* The [Hom:hou.Prim]/[Hom:hou.Polygon] object has lots of useful methods for inspecting the geometry. (Remember that the geometry you get from the scene is read-only.)

    For example:

    * Get the bounding box of the primitive ([Hom:hou.Prim#boundingBox]).

    * Get the value of a primitive attribute ([Hom:hou.Prim#attribValue]).

    * Get references to the polygon's vertices ([Hom:hou.Prim#vertices]).

    * Use the `uvw` coordinates returned by `sopGeometryIntersection()` to look up the blended value of a point attribute at that location on the polygon surface ([Hom:hou.Prim#attribValueAtInterior]).

* Note that some primitive, point, or vertex related methods might be on the [Hom:hou.Geometry] object rather than on [Hom:hou.Prim], [Hom:hou.Point], or [Hom:hou.Vertex].

    For example, if you want a list of all current primitive attributes, that information is actually on the `Geometry` object ([Hom:hou.Geometry#primAttribs]).


== Intersecting a plane == (cplane)

The [Hom:hou.hmath#intersectPlane] function lets you find the intersection position between a ray and an arbitrary plane.

The `intersectPlane` function expects the plane in the form of an origin and a normal vector. Often you will want to project the pointing ray onto the construction plane or reference plane. You can get the position and orientation of the construction or reference plane as a transformation matrix, but you will have to do some conversion to turn that into an origin and normal. The following function shows how to do the conversion and get the intersection with a plane object.

{{{
#!python

# In stateutils
def cplaneIntersection(scene_viewer, ray_origin, ray_dir):
    # Find the intersection between the pointing ray and the construction
    # plane. Returns a hou.Vector3 representing the point in world space,
    # or raises an exception if the ray does not hit the plane

    # Grab a reference to the construction plane
    cplane = scene_viewer.constructionPlane()
    # Get the construction plane's transform matrix
    xform = cplane.transform()  # type: hou.Matrix4

    # The "rest" position for the construction plane has origin=0, 0, 0
    # and normal=0, 0, 1. We can multiply the current transform matrix by
    # those vectors to get the current origin and normal.
    cplane_origin = hou.Vector3(0, 0, 0) * xform  # type: hou.Vector3
    cplane_normal = hou.Vector3(0, 0, 1) * xform.inverted().transposed()

    # Use convenience function in hmath to find intersection
    return hou.hmath.intersectPlane(
        cplane_origin, cplane_normal, ray_origin, ray_dir
    )

# Grab a reference to a scene viewer's construction plane.
# Note you could do scene_viewer.referencePlane() to get the
# reference plane instead.
cplane = scene_viewer.constructionPlane()
# Given a ray origin and direction, computer the intersection
# point with the construction plane
point = cplane_intersection(cplane, origin, direction)
}}}


== Flexible intersection == (flex)

For some tools, you might want to project onto geometry if it's available, or onto the construction plane if the pointing ray doesn't hit any geometry. For example:

{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function

from stateutils import sopGeometryIntersection


class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer
        self._geometry = None

    def onEnter(self, kwargs):
        node = kwargs["node"]
        inputs = node.inputs()
        if inputs and inputs[0]:
            self._geometry = inputs[0].geometry()

    def onMouseEvent(self, kwargs):
        node = kwargs["node"]
        ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]
        device = ui_event.device()
        origin, direction = ui_event.ray()
        
        intersected = -1
        inputs = node.inputs()
        if inputs and inputs[0]:
            # Only try intersecting geometry if the node has input
            intersected, position = sopGeometryIntersection(
                self._geometry, origin, direction
            )
        if intersected < 0:
            # Either there was no incoming geometry or the ray missed, so
            # try intersecting the construction plane
            position = cplaneIntersection(self.scene_viewer, origin, direction)

        print("position=", position)
}}}


== Snapping from intersected geometry == (snap)

[Hom:hou.ViewerEvent#raySnapping] is great for snapping a ray position to Houdini construction or reference planes. But if you need to snap a ray position to geometry components then you need `viewerstate.utils.GeometryIntersector`. 

`viewerstate.utils.GeometryIntersector` is a utility class which provides the same services as `sopGeometryIntersection()` for intersecting geometries. But beyond that, it provides a set of useful functionalities 
for snapping geometry components from a geometry intersection point. Snapping works in conjunction with the settings of the `Snap Options` dialog available in the toolbar on the left of the Houdini viewer pane. If the `Snap Options` settings
are not enabled, `GeometryIntersector` simply perforns a regular geometry intersection.

These `GeometryIntersector` members are used for storing the snapping results:

Member ||
    Type ||
        Content ||

`snap_mode` |
    [Hom:hou.snappingMode] |
        Snapping operation mode.

`snap_gravity` |
    `int` |
        The snap gravity value as set for the snapping mode. Used as a weighted value for fine tuning the snap operation.

`snap_priority` |
    [Hom:hou.snappingPriority] |
        Indicates the priority value used for snapping.

`snapped_position` |
    [Hom:hou.Vector3] |
        Closest snapped position to the intersected point.

`snapped_edge` |
    [Hom:hou.Edge] |
        Snapped geometry edge closest to the intersected point.

`snapped_point_num` |
    `int` |
        The snapped primitive point index.

`test_dist` |
    `double` |
        Minimal distance value for snapping components. A snapping operation succeeds if the distance between the component to snap and the intersected point is within `test_dist`. 

`tolerance` |
    `double` |
        Tolerance value used for intersecting the geometry (see [Hom:hou.Geometry#intersect]).


`GeometryIntersector` performs snapping based on these 2 Houdini [snapping mode|Hom:hou.snappingMode]: point and multi. 

* In point mode, `snapped_position` is set with the primitive point closest to the intersected point. `snap_priority` is set to [Hom:hou.snappingPriority#GeoPoint] to indicate which type of geometry component has snapped.

* In multi mode, different snap operations are evaluated based on the snapping priorities set in the Multi tab of the `Snap Options` window. The order of execution of these operations are determined by the snapping priority settings:

    `GeoPoint`: 
        This will get the geometry point closest to the intersected point, same as the point mode.

    `GeoEdge`: 
        This operation sets `snap_edge` with the closest edge from the intersected point. `snapped_position` is set with the projection of the intersected point onto the edge. `snap_priority` is set [Hom:hou.snappingPriority#GeoEdge].

    `Midpoint`: 
        `snapped_position` is set with the midpoint of the closest edge to the intersected point. `snap_priority` is set to [Hom:hou.snappingPriority#Midpoint].

Here's a simple `GeometryIntersector` usage:
{{{
#!python
from __future__ import print_function

import viewerstate.utils as su

class MyState(object):
    def __init__(self, state_name, scene_viewer):
        self.state_name = state_name
        self.scene_viewer = scene_viewer
        self.geometry = None

    def onEnter(self, kwargs):
        node = kwargs["node"]
        inputs = node.inputs()
        if inputs and inputs[0]:
            self.geometry = inputs[0].geometry()

    def onMouseEvent(self, kwargs):
        ui_event = kwargs["ui_event"]       
        (mouse_point, mouse_dir) = ui_event.ray()

        gi = su.GeometryIntersector(self.geometry, scene_viewer=self.scene_viewer)
        gi.intersect(mouse_point, mouse_dir)

        # log trace in viewer state console
        self.trace( gi )
}}}

== Compensating for parent transforms == (world)

If you want to display [Drawable guide geometry|state_guides] based on the ray (for example, display a "cursor" guide in the scene showing the intersection position), you should transform local coordinates into world space.

See [compensating guide transforms|state_guides#world] for more information.


== Interrupt and Resume events ==

Method name ||
    Called by Houdini ||
        #width: 20%
        Notes ||

`onInterrupt` |
    state is interrupted |
        This method is called when:
        * The window loses focus.
        * The pointer leaves the viewer (including moving over a menu).
        * The user pushes a "volatile" tool (for example, holding down ((S)) to enter the volatile selection tool).

`onResume` |
    interruption ends |
        This method is called when:
        * The pointer re-enters the viewer.
        * The user pops back to this state from a "volatile" tool (for example, releasing ((S)) after using the volatile selection tool).

* If you're remembering and comparing the state of mouse buttons in the `onMouseEvent()` handler to tell if the mouse button is being held down, you should also implement `onInterrupt()` and make it act like the user releasing the mouse button.

    Note that, for the left mouse button, you don't need to track its state manually, you can use [the UIEvent reason|#reason].

* If you want to show something when the mouse pointer is in the viewer (for example a guide geometry preview under the mouse pointer), and hide it when the user is doing something else, you should hide in `onInterrupt()` but show in `onMouseEvent()` instead of `onResume()`. The state is active and the mouse pointer is in the viewer, by definition, when `onMouseEvent()` is called, and using `onMouseEvent()` instead of `onResume()` allows you to update what you're showing based on the mouse position if needed.
