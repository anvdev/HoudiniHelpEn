= What was new in |> Shading, and rendering =


== Shading ==

:new:
    *New [VOP-based shader workflow|/shade/build]*.
    
    * You can now use VOPs directly as materials, without needing to wrap them in a SHOP.
    
    * Much streamlined workflow to easier and more efficient for both new and existing users.
    
    * _SHOPs are obsolete as of Houdini 16_.
    
    * The `/mat` VOP network is now a convenient place to create ad-hoc materials (for example, when you create materials in the gallery). However, you can put your own Material Network subnet wherever it's convenient (for example inside assets).

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/vop_node.png]
        As part of the new network editor, [redesigned VOP nodes|/shade/vops] have new features such as collapsible input groups.

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/shade/einstein.jpg]
        Dispersion and absorption BSDFs.

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/shade/nested_dielectric_render.jpg]
        #display: narrow
        Support for unified [nested dielectrics|/shade/nested].

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/shade/subsurface_shell.jpg]
        New, fast ray-traced [SSS BSDF|Node:vop/pbrsss] with image plane outputs.

:improved:
    :fig:[Image:/images/billboards/shaderballs.jpg]
        Redesigned, feature-complete [Principled shader|Node:vop/principledshader] with extensive features and controls.

[Include:general#viewportshaders]

:improved:
    :fig:[Image:/images/shade/layermix_result.jpg]
        Full support for nested, unlimited [shader layering|/shade/layering]. Layers include displacement shading, allowing layering/mixing of both surface and displacement.

:improved:
    Gallery materials redone as VOPs. New Skin, Wax, and Terrain gallery materials.

:improved:
    Layers include export maps such as diffuse color, normals, occlusion, roughness, and specular. The layer mixing VOPs mix these exports as well as the surface and displacement shaders.
    
    :imagegrid:
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_color.jpg]
          Color
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_metallic.jpg]
          Metallic
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_normals.jpg]
          Normals
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_occlusion.jpg]
          Occlusion
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_roughness.jpg]
          Roughness
        * [Image:/images/shade/layerexport_specular.jpg]
          Specular

:improved:
    #id: texturebaking
    
    :fig:[Image:/images/render/texture_baking.jpg]
        Vastly improved [texture baking|Node:out/baketexture]:
        
        * UV cage object lets you get better tangents and normals.
        
        * New UDIM "Diffuse Fill" post-processing gives better mipmaps in space around islands.
        
        * Tangent space normal and curvature image planes.
        
        * Fixed issues with position and normal map image planes.
        
        * Occlusion-based curvature.

:improved:
    :fig:[Image:/images/shade/opengl_tags.png]
        Easy OpenGL tagging of shader attributes for viewport visualisation.
        Instead of creating hidden OpenGL parameters with channel references, you can now tag parameters on your material as representing one or more OpenGL values.

:improved:
    Shaders now pass UV(W) coordinates as a struct for simpler inputs and outputs.

:changed:
    The functionality of the Mantra Surface SHOP is now available in the [Classic Shader VOP|Node:vop/classicshader]. We expect the Principled Shader VOP to meet most needs, but the Classic Shader is available if you need more control over sub-surface scattering, and/or control over refraction roughness separate from reflection roughness. 


== Rendering ==

:new:
    Houdini can now generate geometry from a SOP network at render time using a new Engine procedural. This does not require an extra license to generate points and curves. (Generating other geometry uses an Engine license.)

:new:
    Fine-grained __Quality__ sliders on the Mantra node's __Rendering > Shading__ tab let you increase sampling quality for components (diffuse, SSS, reflection, refraction) individually.

:new:
    The Packed Disk Sequence primitive will perform correct motion blur of a sequence of packed disk files.

:new:
    Procedural shader to render new [height field|terrain] primitive.

:new:
    Support for nested dielectrics, dispersion, and absorption.

:improved:
    Houdini by default now saves geometry in separate files beside the IFD file. Saving and loading the multiple files is multi-threaded. This reduces IFD generation time and rendering time. Up to 10x faster.

:improved:
    Optimized path termination strategy to make rendering faster in certain types of scenes.


== Stylesheets ==

:new:
    Per-pixel inspection of material stylesheet overrides in IPR.
    
    <img src="../../icons/IMAGE/inspect_styles.svg" width="48" height="48" />


== Compositing ==

:new:
    As part of the new [network editor|network], compositing nodes can now show a [preview thumbnail|/nodes/cop2/].

:new:
    The [SOP Import COP|Node:cop2/sopimport] imports [height field volumes|terrain] from SOPs into COPs as images.

:new:
    The [Loop COP|Node:cop2/loop] lets you apply the same group of nodes to the image multiple times.

:new:
    The [Metadata COP|Node:cop2/metadata] lets you embed metadata in the image (for export to formats that support metadata).


== HQueque ==

:improved:
    Improved web UI including a new job grid view, task summary, farm summary, and a cleaner look.

:improved:
    More responsive web interface. Faster server. Lower memory usage.


== Misc ==

:beta:
    OpenColorIO support in MPlay and VEX.
