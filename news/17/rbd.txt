* Highly scalable, material-based prefracturing toolset for concrete, wood, and glass. See [RBD Material Fracture SOP|Node:sop/rbdmaterialfracture] and [Fracturing objects for simulation|/dyno/fracturing].

    * Convex decomposition using the new [Icon:SHELF/rbdconvexproxy][RBD Convex Proxy shelf tool|/shelf/rbdconvexproxy].

    * New [Voronoi Fracture|Node:sop/voronoifracture] 2.0. The RBD Material Fracture SOP uses this internally.
    
    * New [Boolean Fracture tool|Node:sop/booleanfracture] uses [Boolean SOP|Node:sop/boolean] to break up model with cutting surfaces. The RBD Material Fracture SOP uses this internally.

:col:
    * Bullet [soft constraints|Node:dop/bulletsoftconrel] bend until they break (unlike spring constraints, you don't have to worry about them springing back).

    * 3x faster glue constraints.
    
    * Advanced auto-generated heterogeneous constraint system.
