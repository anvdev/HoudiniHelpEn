= What's new in Houdini 17 |> Fluids and Pyro =


== Fluids ==

:col:
    * Completely redesigned [whitewater solver|/fluid/whitewater].
        :video:
            #src: /videos/beach_small.mp4
            
    * OpenVDB FLIP sourcing
    
:col:
    * [Narrowband|/fluid/narrowband]: parallel, 4x faster initialization, tank-independent (rivers), custom fields.
        :video:
            #src: /videos/river_narrowband.mp4  


== Pyro ==

:col:
    * Color advection setup for pyro using the new [Colored Smoke|/shelf/pyro_coloredsmoke] and [Make Color|/shelf/pyro_makecolored] tools.

:col:

    * New [Volume Source DOP|Node:dop/volumesource] for importing source volumes has much clearer interface.


== Sourcing ==

* [Pyro and fluid sourcing|/pyro/pyro] in SOPs is now based on points with attributes rather than volumes.

    * This conforms better to how most users source pyro sims, for example running a particle sim and then using the result as the source for smoke.

    * Editing/animating point attributes is easier than editing volumes.

    * Generating a volume from the source points now uses VDB and is over 40x faster.

* [Point Velocity SOP|Node:sop/pointvelocity].


== See also ==

:col:
    * Dedicated [Retiming SOP|Node:sop/retime].

:col:
    * [Pyro shader|Node:vop/pyroshader] support for heat, density and temperature.
