"""New features and changes in Houdini 17."""


== Highlights ==

:col:
    * New [Vellum|/dyno/vellum] multi-solver brings _fast_ cloth to Houdini along with other integrated effects such as hair, soft bodies and grains. The Vellum solver is GPU-accelerated and very easy to set up and iterate.

    * The [White Water solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] has been rewritten to achieve a more organic, foamy, look with realistic cellular patterns and repellant forces and a more accurate relationship to the source FLIP sim. 

    * [Material-based destruction tools|/dyno/fracturing] make it easier to set up and art direct destruction shots by providing tools for pre-fracturing materials such as concrete, glass and wood while automatically building constraint networks that tie the whole system together.

    * [Terrain|/model/terrain_workflow] now includes advanced erosion tools with more control over details such as fluvial lines, river banks and debris and new hierarchical scattering for more efficient placement of elements into landscapes.

    * New [UV tools|render#uvs] define a fully procedural workflow that starts with automated seaming then moves on to accurate flattening and super efficient layout of the resulting UVs. 

:col:
    * The new [Retime SOP node|Node:sop/retime] is a powerful tool for stretching out or slowing down simulated data such as fluid sims, RBD sims and even volumes with effective interpolation and blend options for creating clean and entirely realistic results.

    * [Interactive modeling|model] includes a new [PolyDraw shelf tool|Node:sop/topobuild] which lets you use our interactive “Topo Build” tools anywhere in your scene, without reference geometry. Improvements to [snapping and alignment|/model/aids] including fast construction plane alignment and positioning; rotation snapping; view and construction plane memories; and new geometry alignment tools.

    * Character animation and rigging have been improved with a [newly designed timeline|anim] that supports a more animator-friendly keyframe workflow and a [facial auto-rig|/pypanel/autorigs#face] for a complete top-to-bottom auto-rigging solution.

    * Houdini Engine is now more versatile with a brand new 3DS Max plug-in, a 2.0 Unity plug-in and important enhancements to the Maya and UE4 plug-ins.  

    * [GLTF Import and Export|/io/gltf] brings the “JPEG of 3D” to Houdini to provide an efficient, interoperable asset delivery format that compresses the size of 3D scenes and minimizes runtime processing.
