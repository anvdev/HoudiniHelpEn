== Rendering ==

:col:

    * NVIDIA Optix [denoiser support|/render/optixdenoiser].
    
        :compare_images:
            #image1: /images/render/optixdenoiser_before.jpg
            #image2: /images/render/optixdenoiser_after.jpg
    
:col:
    * [Light path expressions|/render/lpe] let you specify contributions by "pattern matching" against criteria such as origin, bounce types, and destination.

    * New PBR SSS sampling for faster convergence in shadowed areas.
    
    * Much lower memory footprint when rendering packed primitives in certain scenarios.
    
    * Support for multiple global illumination lights enabled at the same time.
    
    * Data window support for deep EXR.
    
    * Alembic layering.
    
    * [OpenColorIO|/io/ocio] enhancements.


* If you have a point attribute measuring acceleration (`accel`), you can now turn on _acceleration motion blur_ per-object (Geometry object -> __Render__ tab -> __Sampling__ sub-tab -> set __Geometry motion blur__ to "Acceleration blur").

    :col:
        :fig:[Image:/images/render/motionblur_velocity.jpg]
            """Velocity motion blur used the velocity attribute (`v`) to do linear motion blur."""
    :col:
        :fig:[Image:/images/render/motionblur_acceleration.jpg]
            """Acceleration motion blur uses the change in velocity to more accurately blue objects turning at high speed."""
    :col:
        :fig:[Image:/images/render/motionblur_angular_acceleration.jpg]
            """Angular acceleration blur works with object spin, such as these fast-spinning cubes."""


== UVs == (uvs)

:col:
    * [UV Autoseam SOP|Node:sop/uvautoseam] automatically cuts a model in UV islands using heuristics.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/uvautoseam.jpg]
    
    * Redesigned [UV Flatten SOP|Node:sop/uvflatten] with better visualization, new constraints, and improved workflow.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/uvflatten.jpg]

:col:
    * Redesigned [UV Layout SOP|Node:sop/uvlayout] with extremely efficient packing, exact precision, island matching, and more control.

        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/uvlayout_after.jpg]
    
    * [UV Transform|Node:sop/uvtransform] now twice as fast.
    
    * New UV visualization options.


== Materials ==

:col:
    * [Pyro shader|Node:vop/pyroshader] support for heat, density and temperature.

:col:
    * Many enhancements to [Bake Texture ROP|Node:out/baketexture].


== HQueue ==

:col:
    * License resource and custom resource tracking on the farm. 
    
    * IFD generation can now be distributed across multiple machines. 
    
    * New Render Retries option in the [HQueue Render ROP|Node:out/hq_render].
    
    * HQueue documentation now available and searchable in Houdini help. 

:col:
    * Support for running multiple HQueue Clients on the same machine. 
    
    * New methods in the Python API for editing client groups, querying how many jobs are waiting on the farm, 
    terminating clients, etc. 
    
    * New description field in the clients table.
