== Overview ==

NVIDIA's [OptiX AI-Accelerated Denoiser|https://developer.nvidia.com/optix-denoiser] uses deep learning to remove noise and "fireflies" from a rendered image. It is useful for getting a higher-quality preview of what a converged image will look like so you can make lighting decisions faster.

== How to ==

:task: Download the plugin:

    Before using the denoiser you must download the plugin:

    # In the main menus, click __Render > Download NVIDIA OptiX Denoiser__.

    # Restart Houdini.

    For studio-wide installation, see [manual installation|#manual] below.

:task: Use the denoiser in the Render View:

    Turn on the [Icon:VIEW/display_denoise] Denoise button in the toolbar at the top of the render view. (This button is disabled if the plugin is not installed.)

    In the Render View, the denoiser always uses the "basecolor" image plane (if it exists) as the albedo input.

:task: Use the denoiser in Mantra:

    In the parameter editor for the [Mantra render node|Node:out/ifd], click the __Images__ tab, then click the __Output__ sub-tab. Click the drop-down menu button next to the __Pixel filter__ field and choose "NVIDIA OptiX Denoiser" (sets the field to `denoise optix`).

    In the __Pixel filter__ field you can optionally specify an image plane to use as the albedo input to the denoiser with the `-a` option, for example:

    {{{
    denoise optix -a mydiffuse
    }}}

:task: Choose which GPU to use:

    If you have more than one GPU in your computer, you can specify which one to use for denoising.

    # Run the following in command-line to see OptiX-capable devices listed in order:
    
        {{{
        #!sh
        > hgpuinfo -o
        }}}

    # Set the `$HOUDINI_NVIDIA_OPTIX_DEVICENUMBER` environment variable to the desired device ID, starting from `0` (for example, `0` to use the first device, `1` to use the second device).
