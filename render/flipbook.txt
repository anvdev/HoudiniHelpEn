"""Renders the contents of the viewer as images, allowing you to play them back at full speed."""

== Overview ==

When you are working with complex scenes or simulations,
the viewport can have trouble playing back at 24 FPS
(or whatever your frame rate is).
However, displaying the scene in the viewer is still faster
than rendering the animation.

You can use a _flipbook_ as a "middle ground" between playing back in the viewer and actually rendering the animation.
It lets you view the OpenGL representation of the animation at full frame speed.

When you start a flipbook, Houdini plays back the animation in the viewer,
but at each frame it captures the viewer content as an image.
After Houdini captures each frame, you can view the images as an animation at full speed in [mplay|/mplay/].
Alternatively, you can save the images to disk to allow storing and sharing the flipbook.

== How to ==

:task:Create a new flipbook:
    # In the tools (on the left side of the viewer),
      right-click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] Flipbook tool.
    
    # Choose "Flipbook with new settings".
    
    # Use the controls in the dialog box
    
    (If you haven't created a flipbook before in the current session,
    you can just click the icon to open the dialog box.)

:task:Recreate the previous flipbook:
    In the tools (on the left side of the viewer),
    ((LMB)) click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] Flipbook tool.

== Render Flipbook controls ==

TIP:
    At the top of the window Houdini prints the amount of space necessary to hold the images
    that will be created with the current settings.

=== Output tab ===

Frame range/inc:
    The start frame, end frame, and number of incremental frames to render.
    The default start and end frame are variable references(`$RFSTART` and `$RFEND`), which grab the current values from the Houdini timeline. The menu at the right has a list of common frame ranges.

Leave Playbar at Last Frame:
    Instead of setting the playbar frame back to the frame it was at before the flipbook was started, leave it at the last frame the flipbook wrote.

Flipbook to MPlay:
    When enabled, all frames will be written to MPlay for interactive viewing.
    
Output Files:
    Allows saving of the frames to image files. Normally this is blank as frames are only written to MPlay ( __Flipbook to MPlay__ defaults to on). If a filename is placed here, it will additionally write the frames to [files|/render/expressions] as well. If __Flipbook to MPlay is off, frames will only be written to disk.
    
Flipbook Session Label:
    When __Flipbook to MPlay__ is enabled, you can render to separate flipbooks at the same time by giving them different labels. If you use a label corresponding to an open mplay window, Houdini will  send the new frames to that window.

Visible objects:
    Only objects whose names match this pattern will be visible in the flipbook.
    Use this to focus the flipbook on one or a few characters/objects.

Render:
    What part of the Scene View to render to the flipbook.
    
    Current Viewport:
        Render the currently selected viewport.
    Current Beauty Pass:
        Render the beauty pass of the currently selected viewport, which excludes the background, grid, handles, and decorations.
    All Viewports:
        Render all viewports into a single image, including any viewer annotations such as messages, __Draw Time__, and __Geometry Information__.

Object Types:
    Which objects to include in the flipbook, by type.

    Currently Visible:
       All object types that are currently visible will be rendered.
    Geometry Objects:
       Only geometry objects will be rendered, which excludes bone, muscle, null, camera, light, and blend objects.
    Currently Visible except Geometry:
       All currently visible object types except for geometry will be rendered.
    All:
       All object types will be rendered.

Append frames to current flipbook:
    Adds the frames on to the end of the last flipbook you created, instead of starting a new flipbook. This lets you put together a flipbook of different parts of a larger animation.
    
Scoped channel key frames only:
    Only render at frames where there exists currently scoped keys.
    
Enable block editing:
    When __Flipbook to MPlay__ is enabled`, generate a flipbook with keyframe information to enable blocking in mplay.
    
Initialize Simulation OPs:
    Reset all simulation nodes in the scene before creating the flipbook.
        
=== Flipbook tab ===
        
Audio filename:
    A sound file to play during the flipbook.
    
Audio offset:
    Time (in seconds) of the audio that corresponds to the first animation frame.
    
Background images:
    When __Output__ is `ip` (that is, you are rendering the flipbook into mplay),
    an image to show behind the flipbook animation.

Gamma:
    When __Output__ is `ip` (that is, you are rendering the flipbook into mplay),
    the gamma correction value to use in [mPlay|/mplay/].
    
LUT:
    When __Output__ is `ip` (that is, you are rendering the flipbook into mplay),
    a color look up table (LUT) file to use in [mPlay|/mplay/].

=== Effects ===

Antialias:
    Whether to do anti-aliasing of the viewport graphics, and how much.
    The default uses the current setting in Houdini.
    
Motion Blur:
    Render motion blur when creating the flipbook.

Frames:
    When __Motion blur__ is on,
    the number of subframes to use when computing the motion blur.
    More frames produce better results, but take longer.
    
    The menu determines when the subframes are sampled.
    For any frame `F`...
    
    Forward:
        Blurs `F` to `F+1`.
    
    Previous:
        Blurs `F-1` to `F`.
    
    Centered:
        Blurs `F-1/2` to `F+1/2`.

Shutter:
    When __Motion blur__ is on, how long the camera shutter is open.
    Longer shutter time produces more blur.
    The default ("from camera") uses the current camera's setting in Houdini.
    
    For example, if the value is 0 there is no blur.
    If the value is 1 there is full frame blur.
        
Depth of Field:
    Simulate depth of field in the flipbook.
    
    The default ("from camera") uses the current camera's setting in Houdini.
    
Quality:
    When __Depth of field__ is on,
    the number of renders done per frame to simulate depth of field.
    Higher numbers produce better quality flipbooks but are slower.

Focus Length:
    When __Depth of field__ is on and set to __Specify__,
    the distance from the camera at which objects are in focus.
    
Aperture:
    When __Depth of field__ is on and set to __Specify__,
    the amount that the iris is opened.
    Higher numbers produce more DOF blur.

F stop:
    When __Depth of field__ is on and set to __Specify__,
    how quickly the focus drops off from the focus distance.
    Large F-stops produce a long area of focus (less blur).
    Small F-stops produce a very small area of focus
    (only the objects at the Focus Length will be in focus).

=== Size ===
        
Zoom:
    Reduce the size of the images as they are saved (to disk or in memory).
    Use this to save disk/memory space.

Resolution:
    Specify a custom size for the flipbook images.
    When the checkbox is on, the flipbook uses the current viewer size.
    
Crop Out View Mask Overlay:
    When this option is on, areas of the flipbook image outside the camera's
    aspect ratio are cropped.
    
    When this option is off, areas outside the camera's aspect ratio are grayed out.
