== Overview ==

Motion blur simulates the effect where fast-moving objects look blurry or streaky on film because an object noticeably changes position while the camera shutter is open.

Mantra supports three types of simulated motion blur. The type you use depends on what type of animated geometry you want to blur.

* _Transform_ motion blur simulates blur by interpolating an object's transform between frames. This is the default type of blur applied to all objects when you [turn on motion blur|#settings]. It is cheap to compute, but it doesn't blur _deformations_, that is the object's geometry changing shape over time.

* _Deformation_ motion blur simulates blur by re-cooking an object's geometry between frames. You control it with the [geometry motion samples setting|#settings]. This is necessary to properly blur deforming geometry. This is relatively expensive to compute, since Houdini must cook the geometry and send it to Mantra for each additional segment of blur you want.

    Deformation blur also lets you blur _attribute change_ over the shutter time. For example, if point colors are changing rapidly as the object moves, you can blur the `Cd` attribute. You must explicitly specify which attributes to blur using the [Mantra:vm_segmentattrs] property.

* _Velocity_ motion blur simulates blur by interpolating point positions based on velocity (`v`) and possibly acceleration (`accel`) and/or angular velocity (`w`) point attributes. This type of motion blur is necessary when the number of points in the geometry changes over time, such as in a particle or fluid simulation. See [velocity motion blur|#velocity] below for more information.


== Render settings == (settings)

On the Mantra node, turn on __Allow motion blur__ on the __Rendering__ tab. This will reveal three additional parameters: __Xform time samples__, __Geo time samples__, and __Shutter offset__.

[IncludeProp:allowmotionblur]

[IncludeProp:xform_motionsamples]

[IncludeProp:geo_motionsamples]

[IncludeProp:shutteroffset]

[IncludeProp:vm_imageblur]

The __Motion Factor__ parameter is on the __Dicing__ tab.

[IncludeProp:vm_motionfactor]

The Camera object has a __Sampling__ tab which contains parameters related to shutter speed as well as depth of field. For Motion Blur, the relevant parameter is __Shutter Time__.

[IncludeProp:shutter]


== Velocity motion blur == (velocity)

Velocity motion blur blurs based on motion information encoded in point attributes. It is the only blur type that can handle the number of points/primitives in the object changing over time. (Deformation motion blur can't handle changing point/primitive numbers because it can't know which components from one sample correspond to which components in the next sample.)

This type of blur is most useful for point-based simulations, such as particles and fluids, where the number of points changes as the simulation runs, and the solvers often automatically create the appropriate attributes for you.

Another useful case for geometry motion blur is when you have large amounts of geometry whose animation is derived from Geometry (SOP)-level transformations or deformations. In these cases, using more deformation samples is not recommended because Mantra will have to store multiple copies of the geometry in memory. Instead, using motion blur is more efficient and uses less memory.

This blur type is enabled per-object. To enable this capability, you must set the __Geometry velocity blur__ menu on an object's __Sampling__ tab to "Velocity" or "Acceleration".

[IncludeProp:geo_velocityblur]

TIP:
    If your geometry doesn't already have `v` or `accel` attributes, you can measure and add them using the [Point Velocity SOP|Node:sop/pointvelocity].


== Object specific sampling ==

Since all of the objects in your scene can be moving at different rates or have drastically different amounts of sub-frame motion, it can be useful to sample specific objects at different rates than others. This can be especially important for deforming objects which may require high Geo Time Samples - isolating the most important objects can reduce memory overhead.

Add the following properties ([how?|/props/]) to your object:

* [Mantra:xform_motionsamples]
* [Mantra:geo_motionsamples]
* [Mantra:shutteroffset]
* [Mantra:vm_motionfactor]

Enabling Motion blur is a global setting on the Mantra node and canâ€™t be set per object, however, reducing Xform and Geo Time samples to a value of 1 will essentially disable motion blur for those objects.

Keep in mind that the motion of the Camera can also contribute to motion blur and can also have its own sampling rates applied.
