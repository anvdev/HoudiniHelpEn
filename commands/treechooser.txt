"""Presents a graphical interface to the user to choose from
a list of options."""

@usage
    # `treechooser [-r] [-s <<selected>>] [-t <<title>>] [-h <<help>>] choice1 choice2 ...`

The treechooser command presents the list of strings using a tree-style
graphical interface.  The choices are parsed as if they were path names, with a
slash separating the path components.  The options are then organized into a
tree for selection.

Only choices explicitly specified can be selected.

@options
`-b`:
    Allow selecting of branches.

    If this option is not present, only the exact paths specified in the
    arguments will be chosen.  With this option, selecting a branch will
    choose all the children under the branch.
`-c`:
    Allow selects children with their ancestors.
`-r`:
    Radio (only one choice can be selected).
    
    When this option is not present, the command will return
    multiple choices as a space-separated list.
`-t`:
    Title for choice window.
`-h`:
    Help string to present to the user (only in non-graphical mode)
`-s`:
    Specify initial selection of nodes in the tree.  The option takes a space
    separated list of choices.

@examples

{{{
treechooser -t "Pick Some Objects" \
    -s "/obj/geo1 /obj/subnet1/geo1" \
    "/obj/geo1" \
    "/obj/geo2" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo1" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo2" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo3" \
}}}

Opens a graphical interface for a tree with an initial selection of `/obj/geo1`
and `/obj/subnet1/geo1`.  The command will print out
`"/obj/geo1 /obj/subnet1/geo1"` if the accepts the initial selection.  The user
will not be able to select `/obj` or `/obj/subnet1` since they weren't
specified explicitly on the command line.

{{{
treechooser -t "Pick Some Objects" \
    "/obj" \
    "/obj/geo1" \
    "/obj/geo2" \
    "/obj/subnet1" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo1" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo2" \
    "/obj/subnet1/geo3" \
}}}

Opens the tree interface with no initial selection.  This usage will allow the
user to select `/obj` or `/obj/subnet1`.
