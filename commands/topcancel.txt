"""Cancels a cooking TOP network"""

:usage: `topcancel [-p] [<<node_name...>>]`

This command cancels the cook in the specified TOP nodes(s). If no path
is specified, the command will try to use the current node as the TOP
node. The command will block the caller until the cancel operation has
completed. If the -p option is specified the cook is paused instead of
cancelled.

This command is the same as clicking the __Cancel Cook__ button on a
[TOP Network|Node:obj/topnet]

@options
    `-p`:
	Pause the cook instead of cancelling it.
