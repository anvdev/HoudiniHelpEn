"""Set various crowd agent display options for a viewport."""

:usage: `viewagentopts [<<options>>] <<viewports>> `

This command can be used to change display options relating to crowd agent
rendering on a single viewport or multiple viewports.


@options
   `-b <<base_lod>>`:
       Sets the base level of detail level for the agents. 
       Normally this is zero, which uses the original mesh for the agent as 
       the base level of detail. If set to higher levels, polyreduced meshes
       will be used as the base level. <<base_lod>> should be less than 
       <<max_lod>> (specified with `-m`). This is an optimization option and
       increasing this value will improve performance at the expense of 
       mesh quality.

   `-d <<deform_level>>`:
       Sets the performance level of bone deformation done on agents, where
       <<deform_level>> is:
          0: 
             All agents use 4-bone deformation (higher quality)
          1:
             The original agent mesh uses 4 bone deformation, while all 
             polyreduced agents use a faster 1-bone deformation.
          2: 
             All agents use the fast 1-bone deformation (higher performance)

   `-L on|off`:
       Turn agent level-of-detail display on or off. If off, none of the other
       level-of-detail performance options have any effect (only the 
       <<deform_level>> is still used), and all the agents are drawn at the 
       full detail level.

   `-l <<lod_quality>>`:
       Set the level-of-detail quality. Positive values will bias the LOD
       system towards higher detail agent meshes and boost display quality, 
       while negative values will use lower detail meshes and boost performance.
       The effective range of <<lod_quality>> is -6 to 6.

   `-m <<num_lod_levels>>`:
       Generate up to <<num_lod_levels>> levels of poly-reduced meshes. The 
       <<lod_min_points>> setting may cause LOD level generation to stop shy
       of the requested number of levels, if more levels would go below that
       setting. Each level has roughly half the number of polygons as the 
       previous level. Complex agent models may need more levels than the 
       default 4 LOD levels (which is in addition to the primary, unreduced
       original model). 

   `-p <<lod_min_points>>`:
       Specify a lower limit for reduced detail polygon meshes. This will halt
       the generation of more LOD levels if they would produce fewer points
       than <<lod_min_points>>.
