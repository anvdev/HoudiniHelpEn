:usage: `viewname [-n <<name>>] [-l on|off] <<viewport>> [<<viewport2>> ...]`

Viewports in the same viewer must have unique names. If you specify a
name for more than viewport in the same viewer, the names will have
numbers appended or incremented at the end to make them unique.

If you do not specify -n and/or -l, the command does nothing.


@options
    `-n <<name>> `:
    `-l on|off`:
        (Lock) If on, prevents Houdini from changing the name
        automatically. For example, changing a viewport from perspective
        to top usually causes it to be renamed "top1", removing any
        custom name. To preserve the custom name, use "-l on".

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewname -n custom1 -l on Build.panetab1.world.persp1
    }}}
    Change the viewport called persp1 in the the first pane of the Build
    desktop to be called custom1 The name custom will be preserved even
    if the viewport changes type.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewname -n custom -l off Build.panetab1.world
    }}}
    Change all four viewports to be called custom, custom1, custom2 and
    custom3: When they are changed to a different type, the name will be
    lost.
