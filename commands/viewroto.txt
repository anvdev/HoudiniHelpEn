"""Sets image and position options for the viewport background."""

:usage: `viewroto [<<@options] <<viewtype>> <<viewports/view-memories>> `

You can paste an image in the background of a viewport for rotoscoping or reference purposes. This command sets the image source and positioning options for the display of the background image. To set the display, quality, and filtering options use [viewbackground|/commands/viewbackground].

Some rotoscope parameters can be specified per viewport type. The <<viewtype>>  must be one of `persp`, `cam`, `top`, `front`, `right`, `bottom`, `back`, `left`, or `uv`. The `cam` settings are used when looking through a camera object. The `persp` settings are used in a free view without a camera. The `uv` settings are for the UV viewport, and the others refer to the various fixed-axis orthographic views.

Without any options, the command prints the current values for the viewport/view-memory you specify.


@options
    `-S file|cop`:
        source of the background image.
    `-F <<filename>> `:
        Sets the filename from which to get the image. Only applies when "-S file".
    `-C <<cop_path>> `:
        Set the compositing operator to use for the background image. This option lets you set the operator with just a path. Use `-c` to set the network and COP separately. Only applies when "-S cop".
    `-c <<ice_name>> <<cop_name>> `:
        Set the compositing operator to use for the background image. This option lets you set the network and COP separately, use `-C` to set the operator using just a path. Only applies when "-S cop".
    `-a on|off`:
        Automatic position/scaling of background image on/off. If off, you must manually position and scale the image with `-o` and `-s`. Only applies to 3D viewports/view-memories.
    `-o <<x>> <<y>> `:
        Offsets the image by <<x>> and <<y>>. Only applies to 3D viewports/view-memories, and only has an effect when automatic position/scaling is off.
    `-s <<x>> <<y>> `:
        Scales the image by <<x>> and <<y>>. Only applies to 3D viewports/view-memories, and only has an effect when automatic position/scaling is off.
    `-B <<brightness>> `:
        Sets the brightness of the background image.
