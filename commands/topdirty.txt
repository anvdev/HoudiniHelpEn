"""Dirties the specified TOP node(s) or network(s)"""

:usage: `topdirty [-d] [<<node_name...>>]`

This command deletes all work items in the specified TOP nodes(s) and
networks(s). If no path is specified the command attempts to use the current
node as the target TOP node.

If the target node is a TOP network, all work items in the graph are removed.
Otherwise if the node is a TOP node or subnetwork, the specified node and any
downstream nodes are dirtied. The -d option indicates that output files
associated with the work items should also be deleted.

Calling this command will cause any active cooks in the specified TOP
networks to be cancelled before the dirty operation is performed.

When run on [TOP Network|Node:obj/topnet] this command is the same as clicking
the __Dirty All__ button on the network. When run on a node, this command is
the same as ((RMB)) __Dirty This Node__ on that TOP node.

@options
    `-d`:
	Delete output files associated with removed work items, in addition
	to dirtying the specified nodes.
