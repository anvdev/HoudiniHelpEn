"""Sets the options for the view snapshot memory."""

:usage: `viewsnapshotoption [-s on|off] [-h on|off] [-a <<alpha>>] [-v <<objects>>] <<viewer>> `

This command can set the value of snapshot alpha blending, specify the
objects that are visible when a snapshot is taken, and set the flags
options for the snapshot memory.

A viewer argument is a name of a pane for viewing the scene. A viewer
can be subdivided into up to four viewports (such as top, left, front,
and perspective).

Viewers have names of the form "<<desk>>.<<pane>>.<<type>>", where:

desk:
    The name of the desk containing the viewer pane.
pane:
    The name of the viewer pane.
type:
    "world", "particle", or "texture", depending on the contents of the
    pane.
If no options are specified, the command that sets the current options
is printed out.


@options
    `-s on|off `:
        This flag determines whether a snapshot is displayed at the
        frame at which it was taken (i.e., at source frame)
    `-h on|off`:
        This flag determines whether handles are hidden when a snapshot
        is taken
    `-a <<alpha>> `:
        Sets the alpha value for blending snapshots with a scene view
    `-v <<objects>> `:
        Sets the objects that are visible when a snapshot is taken
