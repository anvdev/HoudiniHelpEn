"""Set various options of a viewport."""

:usage: `viewdispopts [<<options>>] <<viewports>> `

Similar to viewdisplay, this command allows you to set display options for a 
viewport.

@options
    `-a on|off`:
          Turns on or off display of object origin guides.

    `-s on|off`:
          Turns on or off display of current and selected object highlighting
          when viewing objects at the scene level.

    `-w <<alpha>>`:
          Specifies the interior wire alpha for wireframe representations of
          geometry with internal structure, such as tetrahedron meshes. 1.0 will
          draw opaque interior wires, while 0.0 will remove them entirely. The
          default is 0.1, which draws internal wireframe lines faintly.

    `-x on|off`:
          Enables of disables support for drawing X-Ray objects. If off, the
          X-Ray flag on objects is ignored.

    `-X on|off`:
          Turns on or off high quality X-Ray object rendering. Only has an
          effect if X-Ray rendering is turned on.
