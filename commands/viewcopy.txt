"""Copies settings from one viewport or view-memory to another."""

:usage: `viewcopy <<source>> <<destination>> [<<destination2>> ...]`

a viewport, copy the state stored in the memory buttons back to a
viewport, or copy settings between different viewports.

NOTE:
    If <<destination>> is a view-memory that does not exist, it will be
    created.
