:usage: `viewprojection [-o ortho|perspective] <<viewports/view-memories>>`

The command lets you switch a perspective viewport between true
perspective (where parallel lines converge at the horizon) and
isographic projection (where parallel lines remain parallel).


@options
    `-o ortho|perspective`:
        Set the projection type of the viewport/view-memory.
