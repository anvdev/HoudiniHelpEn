:usage: `viewlayout -s <<type>> <<viewer>> [<<viewer2>> ...]`
:usage: `viewlayout -d h|v <<type1>> <<type2>> <<viewer>> [<<viewer2>> ...]`
:usage: `viewlayout -q <<viewer>> [<<viewer2>> ...]`

The -s (single view) and -d (double view) options take a <<type>>
argument, a number from 1 to 4, to specify which view to put in the
viewport.

The numbers 1 to 4 do not correspond to actual views (such as top, left,
side, perspective), but rather refer to whatever view is in a particular
viewport in the quad view:

# The view in quad-view's top-left viewport.

# The view in quad-view's top-right viewport.

# The view in quad-view's bottom-left viewport.

# The view in quad-view's bottom-right viewport.


@options
    `-s <<type>> `:
        Fill the viewer with a single viewport.
    `-d h|v <<type1>> <<type2>> `:
        Split the viewer between two viewports (h = horizontal split, v
        = vertical split).
    `-q`:
        Quad view.
    `-T h|v`:
        Split the viewer between three viewports with one viewport taking
	   up half the viewer (h = horizontal split, v = vertical split).
    `-Q h|v`:
        Split the viewer between four viewports with one viewport taking
	   up half the viewer (h = horizontal split, v = vertical split).
