"""Sets general options for the viewport background."""

:usage: `viewbackground [<<@options] <<viewports/view-memories>> `

You can paste an image in the background of a viewport for rotoscoping
or reference purposes. This command sets the general options for the display of
the background image. To set the actual image and its position, 
use [viewroto|/commands/viewroto].

Without any options, the command prints the current values for the
viewport/view-memory you specify.


@options
    `-b on|off`:
        Display background images on/off
    `-q <<quality>> `:
        Quality of the background image.
    `-i on|off`:
        Background texture filtering on/off. When off, individual pixels 
        appear as blocks at high zoom levels, otherwise they are interpolated.
    `-m <<u>> <<v>> `:
        Minimum U and V values for the image. Only applies to UV
        viewports/view-memories.
    `-M <<u>> <<v>> `:
        Maximum U and V values for the image. Only applies to UV
        viewports/view-memories.
