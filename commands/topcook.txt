"""Cooks the specified TOP node(s) or network(s)"""

:usage: `topcook [-g] [-n] [-s] [-t] [<<node_name...>>]`

This command cooks the specified TOP nodes(s) and networks(s). If no path is
specified the command attempts to use the current node as the target TOP node.
By default the cook will block the caller, unless the -n option is passed in.

Calling this command will cause any active cooks in the specified TOP
networks to be cancelled before the dirty operation is performed.

When run on [TOP Network|Node:obj/topnet] this command is the same as clicking
the __Generate Static__ button or the __Cook Output Node__ button, depending
on the options to the command. When run on a node this command is the same
as ((RMB)) __Generate This Node__ or __Cook This Node__ on that node,
depending on the command options.

@options
    `-g`:
	Generate work items in the specified TOP node(s). If this target TOP
	node is a network, this is the same as calling `topcook -g` on the
	output node in that network. If the target node is Dynamic then
	the graph will be cooked up to that node, and then work items will
	be generated in the target node.
    `-n`:
	Indicates that command should not block the caller, and the cook
	should run in the background
    `-s`:
	Generate all static work items for the entire network. If this option
	is passed in when cooking a specific TOP node, the operation is
	applied to the TOP network that contains that node.
    `-t`:
	Only cook TOPs in order to produce the underlying PDG nodes, and don't
	generate or cook any PDG nodes.
